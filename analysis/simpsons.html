    <h1>“No More Simpsons” and what came of it</h1>
    <img id="main-container-picture" src="https://uploads.spiritfanfiction.com/historias/capas/201809/nao-mais-simpsons-14312693-170920181436.png" alt="Front cover of the story No More Simpsons. The yellow outlines of Bart and Lisa are next to each other, and behind them is a background of the blue sky with clouds surrounding them, a reference to The Simpsons’ opening theme.">
    <p>There is a The Simpsons fanfic titled <i><a href="https://www.spiritfanfiction.com/historia/nao-mais-simpsons-14312693" target="_blank">No More Simpsons</a></i> (Não Mais Simpsons in Portuguese), which happens in a world where Homer is a lazy drunk, Marge is significantly disturbed by her husband’s lack of care for her and the rest of the family, Bart is a sex-crazed maniac, Lisa has a best friend, and Maggie (herein Meg) is a boxer. It’s probably the longest Simpsons fanfic in terms of chapters, standing at a whopping 218. Its author, a journalism student named Brendon, <a href="https://g1.globo.com/go/goias/noticia/2023/05/04/estudante-que-passou-em-1o-lugar-para-jornalismo-na-ufg-e-encontrado-morto-por-colegas.ghtml" target="_blank">died in 2023</a>, leaving the story without an ending. This led to “Just Another Simpson”, essentially my version of the story’s three remaining chapters, intended as a homage to the original author.</p>
    
    <p>The initial version of this story, titled only as Lisa, Bart and Maggie (alternatively called Lisa, Bart and Meg), was created at some point during 2017 and mentioned by Brendon in one of his other stories, <i><a href="https://www.spiritfanfiction.com/historia/gravity-falls--rumos-diferentes-9072931/capitulos/9877533" target="_blank">Gravity Falls: Different Ways</a></i>, in a chapter where he also highlighted a few of his other works. The only noticeable detail about this story, aside from Meg's name change, was the fact the story was supposed to happen six years after the show's timeline — something that was kept in the final version.</p>

    <blockquote><b>Note:</b> The content in this analysis has been toned down, albeit not censored, for better clarity and viewing. The original story includes content such as major &amp; recurring character deaths (if you also count original characters), canon-typical violence, an unbelievable amount of sex scenes (from blowjobs to orgies), homophobia, abuse of power, nuclear disasters, (non)consensual usage of alchohol and drugs, self-harm, sexual harrassment, and many more.</blockquote>

    <h1 id="act1">Act 1</h1>
    <p>The story is divided into three sagas, or acts, with appearances from all Simpson family members, but also several other characters from the show. The first saga, or Act 1, contains several plot lines — some of which are only relevant later on. The prologue shows Lisa meeting her best friend, a black-haired girl with <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/albinism" target="_blank">albinism</a> named Cristianne, at a library, while Bart tries to join the “Indelinquents”, the name given to Springfield Elementary’s group of bullies — <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Dolph_Starbeam" target="_blank">Dolph Starbeam</a>, <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Jimbo_Jones" target="_blank">Jimbo Jones</a>, <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Kearney_Zzyzwicz" target="_blank">Kearney Zzyzwicz</a>, and <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Kearney_Zzyzwicz" target="_blank">Nelson Muntz</a>, although the latter seems to have departed the group temporarily at the time. Jimbo, as leader of the group, challenges Bart to tell one nearby girl to touch his private parts; if she did, he’d be part of the group. The sheepishly honest Bart was upfront about this to the girl in question, named Claire, who told him not to do this and instead kissed him. This would start off a long but important relationship throughout Act 1.</p>

    <p>By the start of Act 1, seven years have passed since this moment, and the Simpson family is quite different from last time. Maggie — now 7 years old and only referred to as Meg —, relates less and less to her father, seeing local bartender <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Moe_Szyslak" target="_blank">Moe Szyslak</a> more and more as her own father, something she’s felt ever since <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Moe_Baby_Blues" target="_blank">the day he saved her</a>, an event that happened two years prior to NMS’ events and five years after the prologue. Her brother, Bart, is described as a slob who’s only interested in making sweet, sweet love with his girlfriend, Claire. Homer, even more of a slob than usual, frequently enrages Marge, who believes her own stress to be caused by him. Lisa’s the only one in the family who hasn’t significantly changed, although she remains affected by her parents’ constant arguing.</p>

    <p>Marge in particular got very enraged after Homer misses Lisa’s school recital, instead sleeping in the family’s <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Pink_Sedan" target="_blank">pink sedan</a>. She wasn’t the only one; that same day, Bart and Claire would have a quickie in another school area. When the family came back home, they found themselves being awaited by police chief <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Clancy_Wiggum" target="_blank">Clancy Wiggum</a> and a group of soldiers, who invited Meg to a military school in Jefferson City, the capital of the state of Missouri. Though she would later consult Moe about this, who would give his consent, she was already willing to do so; one big reason for this was her lukewarm feelings toward her family, in particular Homer and, to a lesser extent, Bart.</p>

      <figcaption>It was a lot like this.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>The next big event in the story occurs when Lisa receives a letter from billionaire and Springfield Power Plant owner <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Charles_Montgomery_Burns" target="_blank">Charles Montgomery Burns</a>, a.k.a. Mr. Burns, inviting her to a hospital visit. Burns, as it turns out, is dying; connected to at least a dozen different cords, the ailing Burns is only aided by his trustworthy aide, <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Waylon_Smithers,_Jr." target="_blank">Waylon Smithers</a>, who sits hopelessly next to him at the hospital every day. Knowing that Lisa, who once <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/The_Old_Man_and_the_Lisa" target="_blank">served as an assistant to him</a>, would be one of the few people he could trust in this day and age, he admitted to her that he was never a good person. To redeem himself, even if just for a bit, he agreed to list Lisa in his last will — as the receiver of his trustworthy teddy bear, <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Bobo" target="_blank">Bobo</a>, and also 80% of his fortune; conservative estimates valued the inheritance at least $796 million (dollars), though likely much more. The only requirement was that Lisa would need to spend it from time to time; she agrees to it.</p>

      <figcaption>Filthy rich, but also dying.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>In the meantime, Lisa would also join her friend Cristianne’s band; an alternative unnamed band, they would feature Jimbo on drums, Lisa on saxophone, Mat — a friend of Cristianne’s — on guitar and Cristianne on vocals. They had only one rehearsal throughout the story, partially due to several breaks and vacations other characters would take. Shortly after this, Meg finally departed Springfield for Jefferson City, where she would remain through the rest of Act 1. The Simpson family took this as an opportunity to take a break and go to the beach, inviting Bart’s childhood best friend <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Milhouse_Van_Houten" target="_blank">Milhouse</a> as well.</p>

    <p>Milhouse’s background here is something to notice; he’d shown signs of depression and had been self-harming for at least a while prior to the story’s events. Part of this is hinted to have been caused by the bullying from the Indelinquents, in particular Nelson.</p>

    <blockquote>His friend, Milhouse, was distracted as usual… he was looking around, a little distressed. They were both chatting while the teacher wrote something to be copied on the blackboard. One sat at the desk next to the other, and Lisa stood at the far end of the room.<br/><br/>— Hey, you know what I did today?<br/><br/>Milhouse didn’t even hear him. He scratched a bit under his long sleeve, grimacing slightly.<br/><br/><div style="text-align: right">from Chapter 20, “<a href="https://www.spiritfanfiction.com/historia/nao-mais-simpsons-14312693/capitulos/14734245" target="_blank">A pill in the coffee</a>”</div></blockquote>
    <figure class="center-block">
      <img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gw1CBjGWwAAdOLT?format=jpg&name=large" alt="Nelson and Milhouse" class="img-responsive center-block" />
      <figcaption>They don’t like each other much.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>In the aforementioned beach chapter, for example, Bart invites him for a swim, which he declines; after much insistence, he agreed to do so, taking off all of his clothes — except the long-sleeved shirt he was wearing. Meanwhile, his sister Lisa uses this time to take her mind off a series of events — and people — annoying her. One of these is with her friend <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Colin" target="_blank">Colin</a> (herein Collin), the Irish boy who was Lisa’s crush in <i><a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/The_Simpsons_Movie" target="_blank">The Simpsons Movie</a></i>. Collin lives in Canada, although he dreams of re-encountering Lisa again; although they are not dating, they have a high enough degree of familiarity, and Lisa thinks to herself that she loves him, something he also does. A moment of unease occurs when Collin video calls Lisa — while naked — causing her to ignore him for a while, mostly out of shock.</p>

    <p>By chapter 35 (Advertising and publicity), Burns is dead. Lisa received an unbelievable amount of money, and the rest of the family (besides Meg, who’s upstate) agreed to not tell Homer about it. The rationale for this was simple: Homer would find out and, well known for misusing their money, would manage to zero out their bank accounts. Despite this, Lisa would not directly use this money; it would be Marge, who bought for her kids a dog named Zero and a cat named Pearl. By this point in time, Marge is more willing to use her maiden name, <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Bouvier_family" target="_blank">Bouvier</a>, rather than Simpson, even if in secret, as if the idea of independence from Homer begins to resonate with her. A brief glimpse of the reaction to Burns’ death is shown; the nuclear plant workers got two days off, which they used to celebrate. Smithers was now in charge, and Homer had kept his job.</p>

    <p>However, one of the many remarkable events in the story is the offscreen reveal of a series of lewd pictures. These pictures, spread throughout Springfield, revealed Bart and Cristianne, Lisa’s friend, together in bed, both in compromising positions. Bart, as it turns out, was the last to find out; Claire breaks up with him, and even his own family is horrified by the events. Even Homer offered some insightful commentary on this:</p>

    <blockquote>That son of his was nothing but trouble. A worthless piece of shit. What kind of honorable man would do that to his own girlfriend, especially one so beautiful and nice. He felt sorry for Kary… was that really her name? Kary? Or was it Klery, or Cler, or Spoon (Colher, in Portuguese)… maybe it was Fork, or Dish… it didn’t matter… what mattered was that his son was useless, worthless and so on — he didn’t know many other adjectives.<br/><br/><div style="text-align: right">from Chapter 41, “<a href="https://www.spiritfanfiction.com/historia/nao-mais-simpsons-14312693/capitulos/15199895" target="_blank">Disappointments</a>”</div></blockquote>
    <figure class="center-block">
      <img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GputsuRX0AAacMl?format=jpg&name=large" alt="Bart with a lot of guns pointed at him" class="img-responsive center-block" />
      <figcaption>Everyone hates Bart.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>This was enough to ruin Bart’s reputation in town, and the only person who was willing to sympathize with him was his friend Milhouse. One particular day, Lisa went to visit Cristianne, the other person in the photo, to see how she was doing. While Cristianne was in the shower, Lisa accidentally discovered that her best friend not only had a crush on Bart, which she found unamusing, but had also manipulated the photo <i>herself</i> — using an image of a bedroom, an image of herself, and an image of Bart, which happened to be taken on the day the Simpson family and Milhouse went to the beach. The photo wasn’t real; it was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepfake" target="_blank">deepfake</a>.</p>

    <p>Prior to all these events, other minor events happened in the story. One of them was regarding Homer’s co-workers, <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Carl_Carlson" target="_blank">Carl Carlson</a> and <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Lenny_Leonard" target="_blank">Lenny Leonard</a>, who actually came out as a gay couple. There’s even a full-fledged sex scene in one of the chapters with them — but their role in Act 1 is rather limited. In the beginning of the story, there are three to four chapters showing police chief Clancy releasing <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Robert_Terwilliger" target="_blank">Robert Terwilliger</a>, most known as Sideshow Bob, from prison. He does not make any notable appearances in this Act.</p>

    <p>Back to the present, it’s revealed that in two weeks, there will be a party held for <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Apu_Nahasapeemapetilon" target="_blank">Apu</a> and <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Manjula_Nahasapeemapetilon" target="_blank">Manjula</a>’s children, the <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/The_Nahasapeemapetilon_Octuplets" target="_blank">Octuplets</a>. This leads to another argument between Marge and Homer, when he notices she spent an enormous amount of money (from Lisa’s bank account) on the presents, something she never did on their home. This would also cause Lisa, aware of the situation going on between her parents, to advise her mom to seek divorce.</p>

    <p>Another series of events occur here; this story, Act 1 in particular, has the POVs of many, many characters, most of which make appearances later on. One of them is Bart’s first childhood crush <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Laura_Powers" target="_blank">Laura Powers</a>, who visits with her mother (and Bart and Lisa’s teachers) <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Ruth_Powers" target="_blank">Ruth Powers</a>. A common theme in this story is the occasional appearances of other minor characters in the protagonists’ point of view, even if briefly. Generally, these characters would appear later on, either in a more major role or in their usual minor roles. One of these happens to be the Simpsons’ next-door neighbor, <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Ned_Flanders" target="_blank">Ned Flanders</a>, whose lack of appearances in the story is explained by Homer in another chapter; two years prior to the story’s events, his two children went to study in another state and moved away, and so did he. Marked for sale this whole time, he ends up receiving an offscreen proposition from Collin’s father to buy the house, which he accepts, and returns to Springfield for about two months to assure the sale goes smoothly and that the house is in perfect condition. After hearing of this, Homer goes livid.</p>

    <p>Meg also makes another appearance in the story, after videocalling her entire family (although she remains displeased at them, especially Homer). A few things have changed since she left; classes haven’t started yet, but she’s met a young girl named Lexanna (the Brazilian equivalent of Leshawna), and also had an unfortunate encounter with her nemesis, <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Gerald_Samson" target="_blank">Gerald Samson</a>, who turns out is also going to the same place. In the end, the only person she really wanted to talk to was Lisa, who had her own plans. Earlier on, she had called Milhouse and asked for his help — something which helps him keep busy for the rest of Act 1 —, instructed Bart to block Cristianne on social media, and had told Claire she was thinking of doing something big, almost biblical — and she’d need her help, even if she didn’t want to believe in her. Lisa was already plotting her revenge. It’s worth noting that while Cristianne had some reservations about Lisa, and even admitted to herself that her friendship with Lisa was only because she wanted to be with her brother Bart, she didn’t hate her. She thought Lisa was a good friend, and even thought she deserved someone better than her. But at that point, it was too late for Lisa to turn back.</p>
    <figure class="center-block">
      <img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GWQT8EnXUAE7SBX?format=jpg&name=large" alt="Maggie handing pacifiers to children" class="img-responsive center-block" />
      <figcaption>Meg’s storyline is very, very exciting, as you can see.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>A couple of days later, Meg is given permission to go back home by the military school’s director: a tall, muscular guy named Boll (a subtle reference to then Brazilian president <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jair_Bolsonaro" target="_blank">Jair Bolsonaro</a>). Meg appreciates the return home, realizing she did miss her family after all (although she continued to ignore Homer and not show many signs of this), being informed by Lisa of her latest plan. It was Saturday. This is where it began, on the day of the octuplets’ birthday. Lisa went to Cristianne’s home, much earlier than she’d anticipated, and the two decided to watch the streaming series “Queen” (a nod to TV series <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crown_(TV_series)" target="_blank"><i>The Crown</i></a>) in her living room. Meg, using her newly acquired military abilities, would climb into Cristianne’s room, where she would plug a flash drive into Cristianne’s prized MacBook, climbing down shortly after. Inside the flash drive was a program that can be best described by Bill, a friend of Milhouse’s, who designed it:</p>

    <blockquote>He created a system as quickly as possible and put it on a USB stick. This, in turn, would open a direct and — unfortunately — weak connection between the device to be broken into and his own personal computer. In other words, if at any point he — or she, he didn’t fully understand — arrived in the room and unplugged the device before the files were 100% through, all progress would be lost and the mission would fail.<br/><br/>Bill certainly wasn’t a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hat_(computer_security)" target="_blank">black hat</a>, since even the simplest of infiltrations, that of just copying the files and sending them to another device, took a lot of work.<br/><br/><div style="text-align: right">from Chapter 62, “<a href="https://www.spiritfanfiction.com/historia/nao-mais-simpsons-14312693/capitulos/15848686" target="_blank">The hacker’s help</a>”</div></blockquote>

    <p>Bill later sent Milhouse three folders: one containing video and audio files, one containing a backup of all her messages, and one containing a series of pictures. It is at this point that he also had a glimpse of what Lisa saw that fateful day. She’d told Bart about it, too; he was so distraught that he couldn’t react properly, but went along with what she wanted to accomplish. Later, when he ran into Cristianne at the party, he asked her to go out with him, right there, right then; she happily accepted. The party was held in the gymnasium of the Springfield Elementary School, which was a large enough place for everyone to gather. Aware that a movie (specifically <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/The_Itchy_%26_Scratchy_Movie" target="_blank">The Itchy &amp; Scratchy Movie</a>) was being exhibited there that night, Lisa asked Manjula if she could borrow the screen for a moment, which she did. And so, everyone at the party (besides the children, who were kept away from the screening by Meg) watched the exposé.</p>

    <div class="pull-quote">With one long, thin, sharp, pointy knife… it would all be over. There was pain at that very moment, but then, only darkness.</div>

    <p>An angry, outraged Cristianne tried to attack Lisa, but was unable to do so, being slapped by her instead and falling to the floor, running away to her home instead. Bart, seeing the surrounding confusion, tried to make amends with Claire, who told Bart that despite everything, Bart never considered her a friend; she was only there to satisfy him, and their relationship wasn’t healthy. This would officially mark the end of their relationship. When Sunday came, Marge received a call from a Ruth, her two oldest children’s teacher, and gathered the entire familyatving room to tell them something. Cristianne was dead. She’d stabbed herself the night before, and her mother, Lenna, discovered it the next day. They were devastated. Homer, understanding the situation, expressed to his kids that Cristianne did not deserve to be mourned, that what they did was right, and that by killing herself, she proved she never deserved to live. Springfield’s reaction to Cristianne’s death was mixed; although mourned by her (former?) friends, and her death leading Milhouse to quit self-harming altogether, others did not react so well to it. Ned, for example, was horrified to see that <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Timothy_Lovejoy_Jr." target="_blank">Reverend Timothy Lovejoy</a> refused to eulogize her or even acknowledge her death, leaving him to console her mother, Lenna, all by himself.</p>

    <p>Act 1 ends with Gerald Samson, still in the Jefferson City military school, wandering to a wooded area nearby and talking to the “Boss” — a tall, big-footed, almost superhuman, mysterious figure who has given him a mission he must follow, “or else”.</p>

    <hr/>

    <h2 id="act2">Act 2</h2>

    <p>Act 2 starts with Bart and Lisa playing chess, seven months after the events of Act 1 and the death of Cristianne — who ended up forgotten. She’s barely mentioned in the story after this, a common occurence with past and future dead characters. This is a particular characteristic of Brendon, who seems notorious for killing many characters in his stories — such as in his original story “<a href="https://www.wattpad.com/623142324-na-sombra-do-assassino-completo-dedicat%C3%B3ria" target="_blank">In the assassin’s shadow</a>” (Na sombra do assassino, 2018), where half of the story’s cast of characters ended up dead. In No More Simpsons this does not occur, but he is much more creative in this Act.</p>

      <figcaption>Moments before disaster.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>In this Act, two characters are introduced. One is Professor John Frink, albeit not the one in the show — it’s actually <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Professor_Frink%27s_son" target="_blank">his son, John Frink Jr.</a>; the original Frink reportedly was eaten by a shark while working on a blood-based sunscreen lotion. Frink Jr. has a son, John Frink Junior Junior — though he is frequently called “Grandson” —, who can be best described as a deeply curious Ritalin kid. His POVs are very interesting because he has a tendency to repeat himself very often, especially when it comes to separating himself from his father, Frink Jr. For example:</p>

    <blockquote>The car continued for 500 meters, until it reached the SBRC — Squabbletown Biochemical Research Center. Squabbletown, by the way, was the town where he, Frink — not him, because that would be redundant, but his father — and Mrs. Frink — Frink’s wife — lived (Frink his father, not John Frink Junior Junior/John Frink Grandson [especially since he was only 13 years, 3 months and 17 days old {who knows if it was still the Middle Ages}]).<br/><br/><div style="text-align: right">from Chapter 77, “<a href="https://www.spiritfanfiction.com/historia/nao-mais-simpsons-14312693/capitulos/16406356" target="_blank">Floorplan</a>”</div></blockquote>

    <p>These two will be more relevant later on. In the meantime, Ned has been getting along with Lenna, the mother of the deceased Cristianne, and has been living in his old house (alongside his two children) since then. For reasons not explained in the story, Collin’s move to Springfield was delayed. In Act 1, Collin’s father, Mr. Manbre, had been recently fired, and getting in touch with some of his (virtual) friends from Springfield led him to discover some insider information: Smithers, now head of the power plant, would repeal and replace 40% of all factory workers with more efficient ones, meaning there would be a job opportunity for him (see chapter 44, “<a href="https://www.spiritfanfiction.com/historia/nao-mais-simpsons-14312693/capitulos/15282205" target="_blank">Good news</a>”).</p>

    <p>Among the houses he’s considering buying is the old Flanders house at <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/744_Evergreen_Terrace" target="_blank">744 Evergreen Terrace</a>, and he tells Collin they would start moving right at the start of December; however, the move does not immediately happen, and only seven months later we hear from Flanders that the Manbres’ furniture would arrive in a week, although the family only would arrive at the end of the month. It’s possible that Flanders requested that Collin’s father (Mr. Manbre) allowed for more time to make sure the house was in good condition, or other events in the Manbre family prevented an immediate move. And Ned, now too interested in Lenna, agreed to move his two sons into her house, as there was enough room for all four.</p>

    <p>Around this time, Bart found out about Milhouse’s self-harm scars while showering in the school gym’s bathrooms. (Afraid of being noticed by him, he distracted him by going to <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/third_base" target="_blank">third base</a> with him.) He later informed Lisa of this, shocking her — although she suspected Milhouse had undiagnosed depression, she did not imagine he was cutting himself, and the two agree to take a look at this issue. Meanwhile, in Jefferson City, Meg and Lexanna are getting along with each other and attempting to avoid Gerald Samson. However, one day Director Boll gathered the student body to inform them of a grave transgression: one of the laptops in the computer lab was stolen. After a few hours of searching their dorms, Boll informed everyone they found the laptop — in Meg’s room, and she was called to his office. Lexanna, knowing she couldn’t have done it, told her that she would find the real culprit.</p>

    <p>In Springfield, Flanders took Lenna and his two sons to a restaurant to eat a fairly standard Brazilian plate: rice, beans, chicken and salad. His intentions were to tell them that he and Lenna were officially dating, but also that he was gonna make sure both boys would be transferred to Springfield schools, as he would be staying for good. His oldest son, <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Rod_Flanders" target="_blank">Rod Flanders</a>, disagreed with the latter; up until then he was living in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worcester,_Massachusetts" target="_blank">Worcester, Massachusetts</a>, where all his friends were, and, skeptical of living under his much more religious father, lashed out at him. He was, quite frankly, tired; his father, besides being hyperreligious, was also overprotective. Ned didn’t know that Rod had a girlfriend, that Rod had sex, that Rod was not the perfect angel he thought he was. Lashing out at him, Rod left the restaurant shortly after. At home, the two however would make peace, especially after Ned realized he was creating mini-Neds instead of letting his sons be themselves.</p>

    <p>Super Secret Agent Lexanna, after asking questions to Quimberly Hills, a teacher of theirs, discovered the laptop was found under Meg’s bed, and that the window in her room was open. In Director Boll’s room, Meg was left off with a very stern warning; although Boll informed her that, in spite of the fact she came from a troubled family (and not in the conventional sense), her in-school behavior combined with words of approval from her friend Lexanna made him go for a lesser punishment. Although Boll found the idea of her doing this ridiculous, he could not let her go unpunished; she was prevented from using the school’s computer labs until the end of the semester — four months from that day. After a bit more investigating, Lexanna confronted Gerald at his home. The day before the laptop ordeal, Gerald had visited Meg’s house to annoy them, and Lexanna explained that, with his hands around his back and himself slumped near the window frame, only he could have done it. Surprisingly, he admits it was him — but is even more surprised after finding out Lexanna also saw one of his emails on the computer lab, all of them directed to “Boss” at the catchy email <a href="mailto:totally.ano@nymous.com" target="_blank">totally.ano@nymous.com</a>. Gerald didn’t just want to frame her; he wanted to make sure Meg had no way of contacting her family. It was at this moment that Samson threatened to, in case she revealed it was him, leak a secret of hers not only to her religious family, but also the school officials: that she was <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/lesbian" target="_blank">lesbian</a>.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile, it would also be the day Bart got his driver’s license at the <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Department_of_Motor_Vehicles" target="_blank">Springfield DMV</a>, where he also took some time to chat with his aunt, <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Selma_Bouvier" target="_blank">Selma</a>. With Homer focused on whatever he was doing, this meant it was Marge — who not only could drive, but also had <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/My_Fare_Lady">significant experience with it</a> — who taught him. Driving through the city streets with an instructor, he stopped by a traffic light near a park — where, to his surprise, he noticed his ex-girlfriend Claire and best friend Milhouse sitting together, drinking milkshakes, and watching her holding his hands:</p>
    <figure class="center-block">

      <figcaption>Pretend Millhouse isn’t in the passenger’s seat.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <blockquote>The signal flashed, but Bart didn’t realize it, being distracted, until the chubby woman let out a fake cough. Ham-ham.<br/><br/>His heart was pounding in his Adam’s apple, and all he could think about was that scene, to the point where he forgot all about traffic laws. He shouldn’t be jealous. She wasn’t dating him anymore. And this didn’t indicate anything other than a possible friendship. But still…<br/><br/>He couldn’t just forget about the six years of Blaire (ship name for Bart + Claire)…<br/><br/>By some chance, when he returned to the driving school and poorly parked his practice car, he still managed to get his driver’s license. But now that achievement didn’t seem quite as good…<br/><br/><div style="text-align: right">from Chapter 90, “<a href="https://www.spiritfanfiction.com/historia/nao-mais-simpsons-14312693/capitulos/16647361" target="_blank">Driving school</a>”</div></blockquote>

    <p>Unbeknownst to Bart, Claire also became aware of Milhouse’s past self-harming after noticing his metal bracelets — gifts from Lisa to cover them up — and he asked her if she wanted to go out for ice cream, which she did. They discover things about each other: Claire reveals she was adopted by her father, Math Kell (he is named Daniel in this chapter, although Math was given as his name in chapter 56 (No boyfriend)), and Milhouse revealed to her that most of the cuts were due to his parents, <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Kirk_Van_Houten" target="_blank">Kirk</a> and <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Luann_Van_Houten" target="_blank">Luann</a>, who frequently argue and disrespect him; thus, the physical pain was a way to distract himself from the emotional pain. Making sure to tell him he wasn’t alone, she gives him a rather symbolic kiss on the mouth.</p>

    <p>A week after the laptop incident, we get a brief scene from Meg and Lexanna at the military school, where Lexanna — thinking that someone in Meg’s family, if not her, was in danger — asked her how she would react if, hypothetically, she was expelled from the camp instead of being warned. Meg, saying being here was basically her dream, said she would be shattered. Recalling that Meg told her that she had a very smart sister — Lisa — something popped up in her head. Not too far away from there, in nearby Squabbletown, a rather <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/febrile" target="_blank">febrile</a> Grandson in bed was watching a documentary about the history of robotics. Specifically, it was about the creation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unimate" target="_blank">Unimate</a>, the first industrial robot patented in 1954 by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Devol" target="_blank">George Devol</a>. His brain was focused on so many things he tried his best to focus on his father, Frink, who came to give him cough syrup and was worried about something else, thinking he had done something “irreparable”.</p>

    <p>Back in Springfield, the Indelinquents are having fun. Their headquarters is an abandoned house in one of Springfield’s many streets, one that has been abandoned for a few years. Today, they’re doing a <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/circle_jerk" target="_blank">circle jerk</a>, where the winner is the one who ejaculates the last — in this case, Jimbo. The winner, he would need to select another member to do a <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hand_job" target="_blank">handjob</a> on; he picks Kearney, to Dolph’s demise — the former was quite well-endowed —, who is forced to do it on Nelson instead. The situation just described is not new to the group; in the prologue, it is Kearney who makes a bet for Bart to show his penis to Claire, which fails. Jimbo, who was part of the failed Cristianne band, wanted to get it on with her — but that failed because of what Cristianne saw as his lack of respect for Lisa; if he wouldn’t respect her best friend, she wouldn’t respect him either. And even then, he had been missing out on an identical scenario that was going on at Nelson’s house. And of course, Dolph also ends up fantasizing about having Kearney inside him.</p>

    <p>But Nelson does not. Although familiar with the group’s standards and practices, he wasn’t in the mood for it today, and soon quit. The loser, he was forced to go home naked — and when he got there, he realized how bad of a situation he’s in. His mother, <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Mrs._Muntz" target="_blank">Mrs. Muntz</a>, abandoned him for another man and moved states, leaving him alone and with only a $50 (dollar) bill, which he is trying his best to not use. While making ramen noodles, he eventually realized that he really needed a job to survive.</p>

    <p>That night, Homer and Marge had been invited to dinner by Lenna, whom they still kept a close friendship with. Reaching the Flanders’ home, Homer — reflecting on their relationship and wondering if Marge didn’t love him anymore — departed the dinner to Moe’s instead, which hurt Marge. A few hours later, at the Simpsons home, Lisa is awoken by noises coming from downstairs. So was Bart — who, in accordance with Brendonian standards, had <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/go_commando#English" target="_blank">gone commando</a> and was naked, to Lisa’s disgust. When they reached downstairs, they discovered their kitchen was almost ransacked, cutlery spread throughout the floor, and the kitchen’s window was open. Outside, Bart saw a person panting, which he recognized as one of the <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Mackleberry_family#Gallery_of_family_members" target="_blank">Mackleberry twins</a>, either Sherri or Terri, although he is unable to recognize her for obvious reasons; she ran away shortly afterward. Bart and Lisa are then spotted by Rod, the older of Ned’s children, who says he saw everything and advised them to come in.</p>

    <blockquote>They both knocked on the door — Bart and Lisa — and he opened it.<br/><br/>— What the fuck was she doing out in the street at a time like this?<br/>— Bart, it’s not that late. She must have been at Sally’s party. Terri, poor thing, wasn’t invited; that’s probably why she was walking home alone.<br/>— Good for her, right? Imagine if…<br/>— Caham-caham — Rod cleared his throat. He wasn’t in the mood to listen to litanies about a random incident — come on in, it’s cold.<br/><br/>The two of them complied.<br/><br/>Although it had been months since the Flanders had returned, the two families had seldom stopped to talk. Especially their children.<br/><br/>Lisa and Bart — who, Rod was relieved to see, had put on some jeans — sat down on the sofa.<br/><br/><div style="text-align: right">from Chapter 100, “<a href="https://www.spiritfanfiction.com/historia/nao-mais-simpsons-14312693/capitulos/16837100" target="_blank">Trespassers: who are they?</a>”</div></blockquote>

    <div class="pull-quote">— Are you all right? I saw what happened. Get over here. And, oh, Bart, put some pants on.</div>

    <p>He explained he saw two <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/voyeur#English" target="_blank">voyeurs</a> near their house, and later saw a third man come out the window to them, but reportedly with nothing in his hands — or something not as big. Rod recalled seeing a small guy, a muscular guy, and a taller, lanky guy with a red beanie possibly made out of wool. Lisa didn’t think twice before realizing it was the Indelinquents, and told Bart they would meet them tomorrow. Back in the military school, Special Agent Lexanna moved forward with her next plan: asking Meg to distract Gerald. This was only part of the plan, however, but she needed to distract him; every time she went to the computer lab, so did he, threatening to leak her secret. With him distracted, she emailed the Simpsons’ most beloved family member: Bart. (The explanation for this is that she could not recall Lisa’s email, which was a string of random letters and numbers.) To <a href="mailto:elbarto.sexy@springfield.com" target="_blank">elbarto.sexy@springfield.com</a>, she sent him a message in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code" target="_blank">Morse code</a> (though Brendon in particular hints at this as a reference to <a href="https://yakusokunoneverland.fandom.com/wiki/James_Ratri" target="_blank">William Minerva</a>’s letters in <a href="https://yakusokunoneverland.fandom.com/wiki/The_Promised_Neverland_(Manga)" target="_blank">The Promised Neverland</a>) and after pressing enter, rapidly deleted the email, logged off her account, and deleted her browser history. A fraction of a second after this, Gerald stormed into the room — and she realized she was screwed.</p>
    <figure class="center-block">

      <figcaption>A normal night in Springfield.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>Meg’s efforts at distracting him had failed, miserably. Even worse: Gerald, realizing that Lexanna was doing something, admitted to her that she was, in fact, lesbian. And Meg, <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/lesbophobia" target="_blank">repulsed by this</a>, is in shock, and decided to stay away from her for a while. Meanwhile, in only six days, Collin would move back to Springfield — and he could finally have Lisa to himself, where they would live and love and laugh and all other things in between. A true lover at heart, his excessive libido only rivals that of the Indelinquents; he’s a tried and tested <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/nymphomaniac" target="_blank">nymphomaniac</a>, as much as he wants to not think about it.</p>

    <p>Chapter 104 (Happiness on a teeter-totter) is, curiously, different from all the other chapters. It’s read from the viewpoint of <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Judith_Underdunk" target="_blank">Judith Underdunk</a>, best known as the mother of Sideshow Bob. She reflected on her life: raised by uncaring parents, she soon met <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Robert_Terwilliger,_Sr." target="_blank">Robert Terwilliger, Sr.</a>, and, after weeks of dating, both moved away to the other side of the country. Robert owed a lot of money to the mafia and convinced Judith (who only became aware of this later on) to move with him. Their next two years were spent living in poverty, until Robert got a job as a hospital assistant, later becoming a surgeon. The couple would have two children — one named Robert, after his father, and one named <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Cecil_Terwilliger" target="_blank">Cecil</a>. Robert, as the older brother, was watching a broadcast of <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/The_Krusty_the_Clown_Show_(TV_series)" target="_blank">The Krusty the Clown Show</a>, when he told his mother that he wanted to be in the show — first as Krusty’s assistant, then as the main host, and finally, get his own program.</p>

    <p>(For context: according to Milhouse in Chapter 1, Krusty died two years earlier due to an overdose of an unspecified drug, and so is dead by about 2.7 years here. His prized monkey, <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Mr._Teeny" target="_blank">Mr. Teeney</a>, is apparently under the care of Krusty’s sidekick <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Sideshow_Mel" target="_blank">Sideshow Mel</a>; neither appear in this story.)</p>

    <p>The next chapter takes us back to the night Homer left Marge at the dinner. It’s a little over midnight, and he went straight to <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Moe%27s_Tavern" target="_blank">Moe’s Tavern</a> expecting it to be closed, only to notice the lights were still on. He’s met by Moe, who, after much insistence, lets him in. Moe in particular had just taken a pill of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sildenafil" target="_blank">Viagra</a> and, like most male characters at some point in this Brendonian rhapsody, is <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/rock_hard" target="_blank">rock hard</a>. Aware that Smithers, now the head of the power plant, wanted to move forward with the employee cuts in several key areas there — something Lenny and Carl were also really worried —, he told Homer that he couldn’t do much about it, causing Homer to go forward and drink a beer. At this point, the bar was now overflowing with other drunken Springfieldians, such as <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Barney_Gumble" target="_blank">Barney Gumble</a>, with Moe unable to keep them out. It’s at this point where Homer explains what happened to him and Marge; Homer’s own words can help explain this better.</p>

    <blockquote>“Six years ago; that’s when it all started. I ordered a cake, dropped off the kids. Then I took Marge out to dinner at a restaurant to celebrate our wedding anniversary just the day before. As I ate, I saw her looking at me with contempt in her eyes…” Homer swallowed, trying not to burst into tears, and continued: ”Not a shred of the love she’s always had for me.”<br/><br/>“She barely wanted to talk to me. When we’d finished eating, she told me she’d planned to spend the whole next day with me and the kids. She’d even made an… itinerant, I think…”<br/><br/>— Itinerary. — corrected Moe.<br/><br/>— Yes, yes… she had printed out a sheet with the schedules. I looked at it and saw that we wouldn’t be able to watch a movie there together. I said that I’d already promised to come by the bar at that time, since it was a promo day or whatever you were going to do…<br/><br/>“[…] You know when someone is angry when they explode, like a ticking time bomb, out of nowhere, and take their temper with them. But with her, Marge… it was different, it was scary, it was, it… it… she just stood up and said, “Let’s go. I’ve got nothing else to do, neither today nor tomorrow”. It was the last thing she said to me for a week. And… and when I… when… I looked at her face… at her eyes… the eyes that always gave me solace and made me happy… they were empty, black… lifeless… they were sour.”<br/><br/>“That’s when I saw that she had had enough… in the months after that I tried everything; flowers, cards, declarations, presents, chocolates, but… nothing worked. So,” said Homer, starting to sob, ”I just gave up, on her, on my kids, on my friends, on me… it was the biggest mistake I ever made. And the worst… the worst of all, Moe… you know what it is? I… I don’t think I’ll ever be able to fix what I’ve done… I’ve lost them… forever…”<br/><br/><div style="text-align: right">from Chapter 106, “<a href="https://www.spiritfanfiction.com/historia/nao-mais-simpsons-14312693/capitulos/16951035" target="_blank">Venting and alcohol</a>”</div></blockquote>

    <p>When Homer came back home, it was around 2 a.m.; an annoyed Marge made him sleep on the couch. In the early morning, they would argue again, this time because Marge made him no <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bacon_and_eggs" target="_blank">bacon and eggs</a> (there were no eggs to be used). It eventually turned into Marge complaining about how her husband spent more time at Moe’s than her own home, causing an exasperated Homer to lash out at her. Distressed, Lisa went upstairs and asked Bart, who woke up confused by the noise, for them to take a walk and talk about it later. In the meantime, we see a glimpse of Lexanna and Meg at the military school again — with Meg, apparently, still horrified over the revelation that her best friend is lesbian.</p>

    <p>Going to <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Kwik-E-Mart" target="_blank">Kwik-E-Mart</a> to buy some snacks and sodas, Bart and Lisa are surprised to find out the cashier there is now Nelson — who managed to find a job to pay the bills and sustain himself. In fact, Nelson basically adored the Simpson family for being so stable, despite everything — despite knowing little about what was going on behind the scenes. They asked him about the Indelinquents, but he admitted he hadn’t been seeing them often lately; despite this, he does tell them they were doing an odd job consisting of retrieving something for some guy. After leaving, Bart eventually noticed an email he’d received, which caused Lisa to analyze the message and discover it read: “WATCH OUT, THEY WANT TO KILL YOU”.</p>

    <p>Chapter 112 (Studies of a psychopath), similar to chapter 104, shows the viewpoint of another character. It’s a guy named Paul Vanhelsin Guillar Zaurd Loney Stuart Junior, who is humorously referred to as this throughout the entire chapter, alongside all other characters. (Brendon in particular highlights this as a nod to both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Adams" target="_blank">Douglas Adams</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemony_Snicket" target="_blank">Lemony Snicket</a>, whose <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Series_of_Unfortunate_Events"><i>A Series of Unfortunate Events</i></a> he was a fan of.) He was recalling his high school days — including a boy, Robert Terwilliger, who was the second-smartest boy in his class and ninth-smartest overall in the school. No one liked Terwilliger; Paul describes him as unlikable, antisocial, narcissistic, and “a real masochist”, being involved in all sorts of chaotic activities since seventh grade. He found out that Terwilliger ended up working as a clown assistant for a small-town show; by comparison, Paul, who was the smartest in their class, ended up with a major job at a company, and worked 6 hours a day, 5 days a week. He shrugged.</p>

    <p>Back to Bart and Lisa, after wondering how to find the Indelinquents, they end up finding their address by doing something simple: asking Dolph. Arriving at an abandoned house, they’re met by Dolph and Jimbo, who — perhaps remembering the incident with Cristianne during one of their dead band’s sessions — agreed to let them in. Lisa heard from Dolph that there was a vacant spot in the group, with Nelson working at his new job — and that Milhouse and Claire, Bart’s ex-girlfriend, were now all <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/kissy-kissy" target="_blank">kissy-kissy</a> with each other. Bart, refusing to comment on this topic, asked them the obvious questions: why did they invade their house? And if they didn’t steal anything, what were they doing there? Responding, Jimbo told Lisa that one guy hired them to invade their house, and gave Lisa an empty medicine box, noting that Kearney took at least one pill from it and felt “strange”. On the back of the box, an address — for the Squabbletown Biochemical Research Center. And so, the gears in Lisa’s head began to turn.</p>

    <p>Bart eventually went to his friend Milhouse’s house, where they made amends, and Bart even admitted that the “distraction” he gave him in the school gym bathroom that day was so people wouldn’t notice the cuts on his arms. Milhouse — who was actually sporting a <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Mohawk#English:_hairstyle" target="_blank">Mohawk</a> and ignoring the fact his dad, <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Kirk_Van_Houten">Kirk</a>, was drunk and naked in their living room — decided to go with Bart to a hardware store owned by a Mr. Skuley; although Milhouse told him that the prices there <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Trumponomics#English" target="_blank">had gone up a lot in the past few years</a>, Bart told him not to worry because money to him was not a problem. That same day, Ned and the family finally moved out of their old residence to Lenna’s place. Rod also packed up his things and headed back to Worcester, but promised to call and come back when his break began.</p>
    <figure class="center-block">

    </figure>

    <p>It was on that same day that Collin, after a trip that should’ve begun seven months ago, finally reached Springfield. He and his father, Dan (not to be confused with Daniel, the name used for Claire’s father), took an economy class flight to nearby Squabbletown, where they took an <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/intermunicipal" target="_blank">intercity</a> taxi directly to Springfield. Shortly after he arrived, Lisa also arrived home; she’d also gone to Squabbletown, attempting to figure out the whole situation with Bart and the Indelinquents, while also knowing Bart had a mission of his own. She’d arranged for police chief Clancy to give her a ride, which he did, as long as she promised to pay him, which she promised she would. Finally inside, Lisa was met by Bart, who told her three important details: Homer hadn’t gone home since yesterday; Marge had gone after him; and their new neighbor had moved in. It was at this point when Lisa realized her new neighbor was someone she was still trying to avoid: Collin.</p>

    <p>Chapter 118 is remarkable because it contains the following title: “A chapter purposely smaller than it would normally be, so as not to spoil the climax of the ensuing saga; in order to do so, I’m going to compensate for such a tiny chapter with this huge title, which may not even be allowed on the site where No More Simpsons is posted; if that’s the case, I’ll write the title in the body of the chapter.” (Due to site limitations, the chapter ended up being named “A chapter with a long title”.) In it, we learn that Homer is… somewhere. He doesn’t know where he is, or what happened the previous day, but he’s having a good dream about eating <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/melons" target="_blank">melons</a>, to the delight of all <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fa%C3%A7ade_(video_game)" target="_blank">Façadian</a> enthusiasts.</p>

    <blockquote>It all seemed so lucid, abnormal; so unreal! Could it be a dream? Homer had his doubts. It was too confusing to think about it all, and as soon as he’d entered his loop of exhaustive reflection and reflexive exhaustion, he’d come out of it. He left what he was experiencing in a vacuum and stuffed two melons in his mouth, without cutting them into pieces or peeling them, and held two more. Hopefully that dream wouldn’t end!<br/><br/><div style="text-align: right">from Chapter 116, “<a href="https://www.spiritfanfiction.com/historia/nao-mais-simpsons-14312693/capitulos/17199896" target="_blank">A chapter with a long title</a>”</div></blockquote>

      <figcaption>It was a lot like this, to be fair.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>Yet more was to come. Another week had passed since Meg and Lexanna had spoken to one another, when a devastated Lexanna came into her dorm and, still in shock, told her that Gerald Samson — her years-old arch-enemy and the person who’d ended their friendship — was dead, his body having been found in the woods earlier that day. And Lexanna thought it was her fault. By chapter 120, we get another of Judith’s viewpoints on life, in particular her sons. She reflected on — and hated — some of the decisions she made in the past, and part of her blamed her husband Robert for it. But she loved him, and knew she shouldn’t easily avoid him. By then, Robert had died, and she’d sobbed. There were only three other occasions where she cried this much: once after discovering her husband’s relations with the mafia; once after <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Brother_from_Another_Series" target="_blank">her son Cecil was imprisoned</a>, and once after her other son Robert was imprisoned.</p>

    <p>Cecil was released years ago and kept in touch with her occasionally, via the internet. Robert, by comparison, had gotten out last year and hadn’t even phoned or visited her. Both were remarkably different, too: the shy Cecil was a fan of chess and puzzle games, loved listening to the radio, and was a straight-A student. The also smart Robert was more hectic, loved burning ants, and was a big The Krusty the Clown Show fan. Robert was also a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_King" target="_blank">Stephen King</a> fan (Judith specifically recalls the novel <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Under_the_Dome_(novel)" target="_blank"><i>Under the Dome</i></a>, which was only released in 2009. Some could argue Brendon actually was referring to the unfinished precursor of same name, <i>The Cannibals</i>), and had a particular interest in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Wall_of_China" target="_blank">Great Wall of China</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Wall">Berlin Wall</a>, stories from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_disaster" target="_blank">Chernobyl disaster</a>, and many more.</p>

    <p>Back in Springfield, Lisa was mesmerized by the mere appearance of Collin in front of her. Collin recalled she stopped answering his messages, prompting Bart to joke about the two of them having broken up — leading Lisa to kick his ankle and curse at him. She even got surprised at this; she never acted like this even after the Cristianne situation, for example. Of course, the madly-in-love Collin would go and lean in, kissing her and leading to a confused and dazed Lisa walk home. Meanwhile, Lenny and Carl were at home watching an animated 2D movie (although the film is not named, the references made to it make it almost certain it’s the 1995 Disney movie <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pocahontas_(1995_film)" target="_blank"><i>Pocahontas</i></a>), when Carl, not too interested in the film, admitted he was being scared of being fired by Smithers. Lenny reassured him, saying that he was one of the best workers there and that only some “Homer-like” employees would be fired. Seeing his boyfriend was still very worried, Lenny found a way to calm him down, and by the end of it, both got into <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/funny_business#English" target="_blank">funny business</a>. They really loved each other.</p>

    <p>And just the day before this, Marge was in shock. She had just been <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/tip-off" target="_blank">tipped-off</a> about Homer’s whereabouts: a local brothel called House of Belladonnas. Homer had apparently hired two prostitutes for about five hours; after breaking in through the door, Marge found out they were indeed getting it freaky. Distraught and angry, Marge argued with her husband and decided to go in with one of Lisa’s suggestions from last year: the divorce. This scene also led to this remarkable moment of the story:</p>

    <blockquote>Homer had a mixture of anger and drowsiness on his face. He got out of bed and stood up, his penis still erect. Then he walked barefoot towards Marge. Facing her… he firmly grasped her arm.<br/><br/>— You don’t want it, bitch! Shut up! When you get home, you’re gonna get it!<br/><br/>— Stop it! Let me go! — screamed Marge, feeling her arm sting.<br/><br/>The chubby attendant came to her aid and pushed Homer hard. He let go of her and fell to the ground. Marge fled immediately, back to her car. Enough! That was the final straw, the absolute worst. Her hands were shaking and her eyes kept leaking.<br/><br/>— Marjorie Simpson, you’re stronger than this, get a grip. — she took a deep breath. She turned the engine keys and shifted into first gear — No… I’m still Marjorie, Lisa is Lisa, Bart is Bart, and Meg is Meg. But… — she got out of there — <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop">No more Simpsons.</a><br/><br/><div style="text-align: right">from Chapter 123, “<a href="https://www.spiritfanfiction.com/historia/nao-mais-simpsons-14312693/capitulos/17276627" target="_blank">Adultery</a>”</div></blockquote>

    <p>Chapter 124 introduces the point of view of another character: <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Ralph_Wiggum" target="_blank">Ralph Wiggum</a>, the son of police chief Clancy. He is playing with Todd, Ned’s younger son, and during one of their conversations, Ralph (who was 2 months older than Todd) called himself a lord (as in, an older person) and said he was above him and everyone else. The religious Todd, horrified and thinking Ralph meant *the* Lord, as in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God" target="_blank">God</a>, and slapped his left cheek, causing Ralph — who didn’t consider God to be so important to the point of not capitalizing the G in God — to be confused. This chapter in particular comes with two notes from Brendon, who emphasized that this chapter “doesn’t deal with religiosity as such, but rather its misuse, religious intolerance and religious fanaticism.”</p>

    <p>Similarly, the next chapter also introduces a new character’s point of view: that of <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Abe_Simpson_II" target="_blank">Abe Simpson II</a>’s, better known as Grampa Simpson. He’s alive and well, but also in an asylum and struggling to remember key elements of his family, such as his grandchildren’s names; he’s surprised, however, when he gets a visit from his son, Homer. Meanwhile, Milhouse decided to visit Claire for a bit, where, after she purposely stained his shirt — and shorts — with soda, she realized that maybe, they could have a little fun. And so they did; it was a <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/home_run" target="_blank">home run</a>. Claire in particular noted she never had this with anyone, including Bart. This may have very well been to avoid an unintended pregnancy; in this situation, Claire withdrew herself before things got serious.</p>

    <p>In Squabbletown, an incredibly <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/neurotic" target="_blank">neurotic</a> Grandson is struggling to think about whether to tell his father about something he’d done. Going back home, he asked Frink Jr. about his day, to which Frink admitted that it didn’t go as well, because he also had to do some things. And in Springfield, Homer admitted to his father that he came there to ask him for money. Abe was perplexed by Homer’s current state; Homer himself couldn’t easily explain what happened. He recalled drinking a can of <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Duff_Beer" target="_blank">Duff beer</a> after waking up, which led to a headache, and after a brief afternoon nap, did a lot of things he would never even think of doing. Unconvinced, Abe kicked him out without sending him any money.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile, in the Jefferson City military school, Meg is comforting her friend Lexanna — or at least trying to. A part of her was afraid of doing so because Meg, who was already skeptical of her because of her sexuality, thought this would lead to Lexanna having a <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/crush#English" target="_blank">crush</a> on her. Even then, they had other things to worry about — someone wanted to kill Bart. (Technically, they had no evidence that <i>Bart</i> was the one in danger; it could’ve very well been Lisa, Marge, or Homer, but it’s possible they picked Bart because he was the most likely out of the three to make enemies, and also because Lexanna’s email was sent to him, and not Lisa.) Meg suspects Sideshow Bob, but Bart had so many enemies it could be anyone, really. Realizing Meg’s family was in danger, Lexanna asked her to go back to her town and protect her brother; unsure if she could still trust her friend, she said she would think about it. Meanwhile, her own family was in shambles; at home, Lisa tried to comfort Marge after hearing about the whole thing with Homer. Bart even wanted to kick his ass, but Lisa advised him to stay away:</p>

    <blockquote>— Bart.<br/>— I shouldn’t take long. — The blond clenched his fists. His voice was inconsistent, so he cleared his throat — I just want to have a word with Homer.<br/>— “A word”, you say?<br/>— Well, it’ll be in ASL (American Sign Language)&ast;. I’ll have to use my hands.<br/>— No, Bart. For now you’re forbidden to talk to Homer; and keep your distance until I’ve sorted the situation out.<br/><br/>Lisa could have started her own plan at that very moment, but she wanted to let Homer have a taste of his own medicine. And Bart would be safe as long as he didn’t let himself get carried away. But the main thing was Marge, the best mother and wife in the world. Lisa loved her.<br/><br/>&ast; Actual language referenced here was LIBRAS, the Brazilian equivalent of ASL<br/><br/><div style="text-align: right">from Chapter 130, “<a href="https://www.spiritfanfiction.com/historia/nao-mais-simpsons-14312693/capitulos/17402764" target="_blank">Motherly company</a>”</div></blockquote>

    <p>The next chapter is from the point of view of Sideshow Bob, a.k.a. Robert Terwilliger. It is here where the story’s biggest revelation occurs. Bob, who has hated Bart ever since <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Krusty_Gets_Busted" target="_blank">he made him go to prison</a>, wanted his revenge as usual. With the help of a certain lab coat-wearing dude, whom he manipulated, he thought his plan had a good shot at succeeding. However, he knew that any revenge would’ve been much harder with the Simpson family members around — despite having no real opinions on any of them —, and it was here where his schemes began, after a year or so of planning. With Abe in a nursing home, he didn’t need to worry. Homer and Marge were having issues with their relationship for a while now, so all he needed was just a little bump to get things going. For Meg, he made sure to make her standout among the candidates for the Jefferson City military/<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/boarding_school" target="_blank">boarding school</a>, and got Gerald Samson to make sure she’d have no connection with the outside world. After hearing that Gerald got another person involved in their plan, he decided it was the best course of action to eliminate him.</p>

    <p>That only left Lisa remaining. Somehow, Bob became aware of the <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/booty_call" target="_blank">booty call</a>-esque “I had a videocall with my girlfriend-in-waiting, ignoring the fact I was naked” incident, and after hearing the Flanders were selling their house, getting the news to Collin’s father (prompting an eventual move) would put Lisa in a tough spot. His plan was also aided by the death of Mr. Burns, which not only put Homer’s job at the power plant in jeopardy, but would make a plan B of his — in case he couldn’t kill Bart — a perfect crime.</p>

    <p>(It’s worth noting that in the story, there are no indications Meg ever applied to a military or boarding school, and police chief Clancy and the soldiers that came with him said they had been checking out her abilities for a little over a year. Likewise, there is little explanation over Collin’s move to Springfield; initially scheduled for the start of December, this move only seems to happen around June-July, the time when the story happens in [as per one of Marge’s comments on chapter 78 that there were only <a href="https://www.britannica.com/story/when-does-summer-start" target="_blank">3 weeks left until summer began</a>]. [It may also be possible that Brendon instead used the start of summer for the Southern Hemisphere instead, which would make this story happen around September-October and Act 1 happening in March-April.] Up until then, practically none of his plans go into effect, aside from putting Meg at the boarding school — yet Gerald makes no effort to prevent her from contacting her family until much, much later. Curiously, Sideshow Bob is not aware of Lisa’s new status as a millionaire.)</p>

    <p>Back to Homer, he knew things weren’t good for him. For starters, he’d been essentially kicked out of his house and was living in a rundown apartment on the other side of town, surviving with an amount of money Lisa gave him (that he had no idea where she got it). And worse: on that day, Smithers announced a series of employees who would be fired from the factory and replaced with more capable, skilled workers. Smithers does not fire half of the factory, as some suggested, but fired eleven workers. The eleventh worker was him. He was distraught. Worse: <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliminationCatchphrase" target="_blank">He was fired</a>.</p>

      <figcaption>All over but the shouting.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>But it’s at this point in the story where things get, erm, <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/freaky" target="_blank">freaky</a>. On that day, Ralph and Todd went out for a swim in the <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Springfield_River" target="_blank">Springfield River</a> — or well, only Ralph, as Todd wasn’t even aware of it until they were walking there. The silly Ralph continued playing with him for a bit, even giving him nicknames such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toddy_(PepsiCo)" target="_blank">Toddy</a> and <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/nescau">Nescau</a>, references to two major chocolate milk brands sold in Latin America, including Brazil. Another nickname he gave for him was boring — because Todd, in comparison to him, was pretty boring. The river was not in suitable conditions for bathing, but Ralph insisted. Todd, who didn’t wanna swim in jeans, told Ralph he would pray for his soul and left.</p>

      <figcaption>So calm, so peaceful.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>And in the Jefferson City military school, Meg is sent to Director Boll’s office, where she spotted a tall, muscular, dark-skinned man with curly black hair leaving. Boll told Meg this was Jefford Freeley, captain of the 13th Public Disaster Event Control Squadron. But he didn’t want to talk about that, at least not yet; he sent her there because he found out she stopped talking to Lexanna over her homophobia. Boll told her that he too, like her, was <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/LGBT%2B" target="_blank">LGBT-phobic</a> for the longest time until he met Jeff and realized he was so, so wrong. And he told Meg that Lexanna, the girl with the highest IQ in that entire school, wasn’t gonna contaminate her with the <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/gay_plague" target="_blank">gay plague</a> or something similar. She was charismatic, intelligent, ethical, altruistic, and much more — and it didn’t matter whether she liked girls or not. Meg, although somewhat unsure of this, agreed with him. After this, Boll told her that, if she’d been listening to Lexanna, she’d know they had other, more important things to address.</p>

    <p>And most importantly, Lisa and Bart are visiting their father. Lisa in particular told Bart to be quiet so <i>he</i> wouldn’t hear them. Homer was still in the apartment Lisa made him stay in, and he and Marge had started the <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/divorce" target="_blank">divorce</a> proceedings a month ago. It was being headed by a lawyer who Lisa knew; it was one of the late Mr. Burns’ many employers. They had only been allowed to visit their father now, meeting a disgruntled Homer while walking inside. He was drinking, <i>again</i>. Lisa and Bart threatened to withhold funding from him if he continued to do so, since they weren’t funding him to drink and be lazy. An outraged Homer began insulting his soon-to-be-former wife, Marge, and when Lisa tried to leave, he grabbed her arm and prevented her from doing so. This led to Bart pushing Homer against the floor — in retaliation, his dad got up, <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Strangulation" target="_blank">held Bart by the neck</a>, and went to his kitchen. There, despite Lisa’s pleas, Homer grabbed a fork, and without hesitation, stuck it in his chest. Bart was dead.</p>

    <div class="pull-quote">“I have nothing against you, Lisa,” thought Robert, “but if it has to be, it will be.”</div>

    <p>And Sideshow Bob knew this. Not because he guessed it, but because he was there — hidden within the roof of the building, hearing everything with his new biological abilities to hear even the faintest of <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/infrasonic#English" target="_blank">infrasonic</a> sounds. After weeks of <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/doping" target="_blank">doping</a> Homer, he realized that, as much as he wanted to kill Bart, he wouldn’t be upset if someone else did it. If anything, it being caused by a member of his own family would make things much, much easier for him. And when it happened, it was over. The villain of the story was dead. <a href="https://twitter.com/barackobama/status/243890464149868544" target="_blank">Bart Simpson is dead, and Robert Terwilliger is alive.</a> Revealing himself shortly after, Lisa rapidly realized it was him, and said she knew he was involved in this. But it was too late now — Bart was dead, right?</p>

      <figcaption>Come on Lisa, the vat of acid won’t stay up for much longer.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Or so he thought.</p>

    <blockquote>It was then that she heard a laugh, typically perfidious. It could only be one person. From the slats that supported the ceiling, coming out of the darkness, Sideshow Bob descended like a guided missile. He slammed into the floor in an impact that literally sank the wooden floor, without even bending his knees.<br/><br/>— It’s no use, Lisa. He won’t listen to you. I made sure that wouldn’t happen. — he said, smiling.<br/>— Sideshow Bob! I knew you were behind this!<br/>— Too bad it’s too late for you now, isn’t it? And don’t call me that anymore… why isn’t that fat slob sticking the knife in once and for all? — complained the hairy man, impatiently.<br/>Lisa couldn’t help but smile at what happened next.<br/><br/>— I don’t think you heard what she said, asshole: She knew you were behind it.<br/><br/>Robert squinted his eyes and turned back. Bart was there, standing tall and well, alive and in the flesh, live and in color, and, of course, with that insolent smile on his lips.<br/><br/><div style="text-align: right">from Chapter 137, “<a href="https://www.spiritfanfiction.com/historia/nao-mais-simpsons-14312693/capitulos/17402764" target="_blank">Death</a>”</div></blockquote>

      <figcaption>Well, if it isn’t my arch nemesis Bart Simpson and his sister Lisa, to whom I’m fairly indifferent.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>Scratch that — Bart was alive. And Lisa knew of this. Homer knew of this, too. He helped Lisa get up and, after clapping three times, the room was swarmed by policemen, such as police chief Clancy, and a cameraman, recording everything. Bob had lost. Again. In chapter 138, we go back directly to Frink Jr.’s point of view, where he explained the things that had happened. His son, Frink Grandson, has <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder" target="_blank">ADHD</a>, and he barely had contact with his wife due to the time he spent at the lab. Specifically, within the Squabbletown research center, he had a small secret lab of his own, although it was hardly secret because everyone there knew it existed. However, they only had a vague understanding of *what* happened in there, only that it was something <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/genetics" target="_blank">genetics</a>-related. It was there that he made a decision he learned to regret.</p>

    <p>Robert Terwilliger was only released thanks to, essentially, a <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pay-to-play" target="_blank">pay-to-play</a>, corrupt judicial system powered by incompetent judges, lawmakers, and elected officials. Despite being accused and charged of many counts of murder, attempted murder, extortion, data manipulation, corruption, grand larceny, contempt of authority, and kidnapping, he was still released from jail. At some point, he encountered Frink Jr., who made him his test subject. Against the wishes of his son, he continued with his experiments. They succeeded, altering Robert’s DNA and giving him <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/superhuman" target="_blank">superhuman</a>-like characteristics. At the same time, he was coerced by Robert himself into continuing the experiments — as otherwise, Bob would report him to the government, and it would be over for him. (It’s worth noting this is very similar to episode <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/The_Man_Who_Grew_Too_Much">The Man Who Grew Too Much</a>, where Sideshow Bob/Robert also genetically enhanced his DNA to get revenge on Bart.)</p>

    <p>Milhouse’s point of view also explains why Bart came back to life. Claire was visiting his house right after lunch, at about 1:30 pm, where he tried some <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/magic_trick" target="_blank">magic tricks</a> on her, using a magic trick kit he bought at the same store he went to with Bart the other day. He also told Claire that not only he and Bart started talking regularly again, but that he also bought a fake knife and a fake bag of blood, just like those used in Hollywood. He must’ve been doing another prank, Milhouse thought. More interested in her own man, Claire suggested for them to do a bit of magic together.</p>

    <div class="pull-quote">Yes, only Mona — a monotonous woman with an expression indistinguishable between boredom and slight happiness. Because Lisa was a different person; Mona and Lisa were different.</div>

    <p>Back to Squabbletown, we get a glimpse of Grandson’s viewpoint of what happened. He was reading an art magazine and trying to make a comparison between Lisa and Mona — as in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mona_Lisa">the painting <i>Mona Lisa</i></a>. The two Lisas were very different, and this Lisa wanted to talk to someone about the medication she’d found at her home — which was made there. No one wanted to talk to a girl of her age, however, and since Grandson was aware of (and disapproved of) his father’s recent machinations, he went to the archives room and sent Lisa a series of files about the research he was doing on the test subject.</p>

    <p>In the present, Robert struggled to recall what was happening. As much of a genius he was, there were just some things that he couldn’t quite remember, seemed to be escaping from his mind, or were within such deep fog that it was hard to reach. He barely remembered a thing about his father, the original Robert. He could feel his memories with his mother slowly dissipating, and this made him sad. And there wasn’t even a hint of a good relationship between him and Cecil, his brother, which made him angry. The only thing he recalled was simple: he hated Bart. Or so he thought… as he recalled a childhood memory, he remembered how much he loved <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Krusty_the_Clown" target="_blank">Krusty the Clown</a>. He liked it so much, he wanted to be a part of it!</p>

    <p>Fast forwarding a few years later, now as one of the interns working in the show’s production, Robert suggested to Krusty that they buy the broadcasting rights to Rower Pangers (a nod to TV series <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mighty_Morphin_Power_Rangers" target="_blank"><i>Mighty Morphin Power Rangers</i></a> of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Rangers" target="_blank">Power Rangers</a> franchise), as the producers had given the go ahead, but he refused, saying he was not gonna spend half a million dollars on it. To Krusty, everyone who watched his show was “a bunch of fucking retards who like anything”, and that Robert was just a “squashed and fucked maggot” on the sole of his shoe. That’s when it clicked to Robert: Krusty was not a nice man.</p>

    <p>Krusty was abhorrent, despicable; he didn’t deserve to live. Yet no one in Springfield besides Robert knew this — everyone else was too obsessed with the <i>idea</i> of Krusty rather than discovering who he actually was. This was when he realized he needed to take this matter into his own hands (likely referring to the events of <a href="https://simpsonswiki.com/wiki/Krusty_Gets_Busted" target="_blank">Krusty Gets Busted</a>), and as he is taken away to prison, he memorized the shape and name of a blond-haired boy that watched him get taken away. Bart, he was named. Robert hated Bart. Yet all of his tries had failed. Except for a certain plan B… it was then that he took a <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/stick" target="_blank">stick</a> from the pocket of his shirt. This stick (cylindrical in nature) had a red button on top. Despite Clancy’s warnings, Robert pressed that button. Moments before he did so, he recalled an excerpt of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percy_Bysshe_Shelley" target="_blank">Percy Bysshe Shelley</a>’s poem <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozymandias" target="_blank">Ozymandias</a> (<a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Complete_Poetical_Works_of_Percy_Bysshe_Shelley_(ed._Hutchinson,_1914)/Ozymandias" target="_blank">see copy</a>):</p>

    <blockquote>Bob ignored him. A laugh bubbled up from deep in his throat, and it was unstoppable. Absolutely unstoppable. Then Bob chuckled, and felt the tension run through those present.<br/><br/>“Yes… my name is Ozymandias, King of Kings:<br/>Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!”<br/><br>So he pressed the button. If he couldn’t take revenge on Bart due to Springfield’s interference, then let Springfield fall with Bart.<br/><br/><div style="text-align: right">from Chapter 141, “<a href="https://www.spiritfanfiction.com/historia/nao-mais-simpsons-14312693/capitulos/17749085" target="_blank">Past</a>”</div></blockquote>

    <p>Going back in time a bit, it’s shown that Lisa, right after getting the documents from Grandson, got in touch directly with Frink Jr. — who now was in no position to argue against the nature of the documents he’d prepared himself. He could, technically, but opted against it. Frink Jr. explained to Lisa that he was motivated by his own ego, his own instincts; his family had studied these topics for ages, and he was merely following his father’s footsteps. With the help of some of his father’s studies, alongside others such as the cloning process which created <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolly_(sheep)" target="_blank">the sheep Dolly</a>, he began work on this secret project, which was kept secret in order to avoid government intervention. His surprise was when someone voluntarily asked to be a part of the studies — Sideshow Bob.</p>

    <p>By the time he realized what he was doing, it was too late. Bob, or rather Robert, had coerced him into preparing powdered drugs to be diluted in <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/H%E2%82%82O" target="_blank">H₂O</a>, a.k.a. water. These ranged from simple substances to make someone more aggressive, to hallucinogenic <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/aphrodisiac#Noun" target="_blank">aphrodisiacs</a>, to <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hallucinogen#English" target="_blank">hallucinogens</a> that turned its users into irrational killers. As if Sideshow Bob didn’t wanna do something by himself, but wanted to <i>use</i> someone to do things for him, unintentionally. This person, Lisa realized, was Homer. She asked if there was an <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/antidote" target="_blank">antidote</a> for these drugs; he said there was, but he’d used most of the funding he’d received during the process of developing the drugs — which he bought in the black market first. At Lisa’s insistence — since she *had* the money for it — he agreed to help her.</p>

    <p>And finally, chapter 143, which is also the final chapter in Act 2, is from the point of view from a different character: Springfield. Not as in a person, but as in <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Springfield" target="_blank">the city of Springfield</a>. It’s the closest to a <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/third_person" target="_blank">third-person</a> perspective the story has to offer, although it is rather unique. “Springfield” reveals that several military camps were hastily arranged around the city, at strategic points, to ensure no one would get out. On that very same day, on the same moment that Sideshow Bob pressed that button, the floodgates from the <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Springfield_Toxic_Waste_Dump" target="_blank">Springfield Toxic Waste Dump</a> (or another adjacent area next to the power plant) were opened, resulting in millions of liters of <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Radioactive_waste" target="_blank">radioactive waste</a> leaking into the Springfield River. In 2 minutes and 32 seconds, Ralph, who was bathing in the river, became the first victim of this, dying of intoxication.</p>

    <p>Sideshow Bob managed to get access to this not very innocuous gadget on the day of Smithers’ announcement of the fired employees, setting up his plan B as a backup. What he didn’t know is that, when pressing the button, the authorities — which were seemingly aware of a possible plant leak — were immediately alerted. Among these were Jefford Freeley — and his subordinates, Hugo and Mathy — who were already aware of possible soil contamination. However, they had dug deep into all the river outlets and implanted technological <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood_barrier" target="_blank">retractable dams</a>, which would stop the flow of water from continuing. At this time, hundreds of army helicopters took off, carrying thick slabs of concrete and metal, and forming an impenetrable wall around Springfield. (Sounds familiar? <a href="https://simpsonswiki.com/wiki/The_Simpsons_Movie#Plot" target="_blank">The Simpsons Movie</a> has a similar plot line.)</p>

    <div class="pull-quote">A mixture of brains, blood and another gooey liquid stained the police officer’s face and Bob’s corpse fell to the ground, inert. He was smiling, even at the moment of death.</div>

    <p>In a <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/last-ditch" target="_blank">last-ditch</a> attempt at escaping, Bob advanced into the policemen near him through his newly-acquired superhuman speed. <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Eddie" target="_blank">Eddie</a> got his head smashed into a wall and <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Lou" target="_blank">Lou</a> was almost strangled, saved by a bullet that grazed his arm and hit another civilian, who died 11 seconds later. Bob went after chief Clancy Wiggum, who fired twice at him and missed both shots. Sideshow Bob succeeded in grabbing Clancy and squeezing his left arm until it broke, and would’ve done so to his right arm if Lou didn’t shoot him in the head.</p>

    <p>Sideshow Bob was dead. Springfield was in chaos. And just moments away from there, a terrified Marge discovered the body of Ralph in the river. End of Act 2.</p>

    </figure>

    <p>Unlike Act 2, which began 7 months after the end of Act 1, Act 3 begins immediately after the end of Act 2.</p>

    <p>It starts off with Lieutenant Hugo Francis Demoyr, or just Hugo, who is one of Captain Jefford Freeley’s subordinates. Curiously, he’s not a fan of Jefford — he finds him to be so high and mighty that he even calls him a <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/fascist" target="_blank">fascist</a> (though in the strict sense, not in the political sense). He was with a group of 12 soldiers distributing loudspeakers through the west part of town (at times like this, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070706025120if_/http://www.mapofspringfield.com/spring_map.png" target="_blank">the fan-made Springfield map</a> is useful), although he manages to get rid of those 12 pretty easily so he can go on his own. Although Hugo had nothing against Springfield and didn’t think this city deserved to go to waste, he thought some of them were corrupted by other <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/black_sheep" target="_blank">black sheep</a>. Yet his emphasis was on *black*, and not the sheep.</p>

    <p>He spotted a few children playing <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hide_and_seek" target="_blank">hide and seek</a>, including a girl who was near a tree crying, scared, and asked him to take her up there. Two boys were up the tree; one of them, black, got down and rapidly grabbed the girl’s wrist. Hugo retaliated — by shooting the kid. He was dead. The girl cried, and the other boy up the tree, likely her brother, went down to comfort her. As other citizens heard the noise and surrounded them, he was satisfied. He had just saved someone’s life from a criminal, he thought.</p>

    <p>Not too far from there, Claire and Milhouse — who she could definitely call her boyfriend now — stood near the city square listening to one of Jeff’s speeches. He explained that a couple of months earlier, they’d received “<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/smoking_gun" target="_blank">strong evidence</a>” that toxic material would be released into the main river by the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. He highlighted that they managed to contain the toxic material and would be punishing those responsible, alongside the fact that citizens would only have to drink water provided by the military, and other information Claire did not focus on. Behind her was Lisa, who, unlike all other times she’d seen her, looked disappointed. Lisa invited both to her house that night at 7 p.m., and went away soon after.</p>

    <div class="pull-quote">— [Lisa is] naïve, you mean. Wait a minute… you mean innocent about sexual things? Hahaha! The pot calling the kettle black.</div>

    <p>The next five chapters are part of the “Water Donation” <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pentalogy" target="_blank">pentalogy</a>, which involves, you guess it, water donation. Collin was in front of the Simpsons’ house, reflecting a bit on what’d happened after his move. Though he was always a bit shy, he expected people in Springfield to see him as this big, popular kid — only because he was good in sports. There, he found a truck with several boxes unloaded; Bart was there, and he agreed to help bring some of them inside. Bart did ask him, however, what happened between him and Lisa. He highlighted they were always really close, even after he moved to Canada, but there was a period where she just started ignoring him. Collin explained, with some unease, that Lisa was just more <a href="en.wiktionary.org/wiki/innocence" target="_blank">innocent</a> than he thought she’d be. Getting some boxes upstairs, Collin himself was surprised when, opening the door to Lisa’s room, he was hit by a phone directly in his forehead.</p>

    <p>After apologizing to Collin and tending to the small cut on his forehead, she’d explained to him that her phone had no signal, and they were all <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/offline" target="_blank">offline</a> — which led to her throwing it at the door, which Collin was unfortunate enough to open at the wrong moment. In the bathroom, Lisa cried, saying this was all her fault. Collin thought this was about the phone incident, but it wasn’t, she said. The soldiers, the water intoxication, the death of Ralph, and the destruction caused by Sideshow Bob… this was her fault. If she did nothing, things would’ve been much better. Sure, Bart might’ve died and Homer, her father, might’ve been jailed for life — or worse — but maybe it would’ve been a better price to pay in comparison to the city’s entire suffering. She should’ve just let her brother die — and even thinking about this made her sad. He comforted her; their moment was briefly interrupted by Bart opening the bathroom door and seeing the scene, but closing the door instead of commenting on it.</p>
    <figure class="center-block">
      <img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GqRZ7TYWkAA_MuR?format=jpg&name=large" alt="Lisa looks at herself in the bathroom" class="img-responsive center-block" />
      <figcaption>It is not a fair world.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>Homer, after the events of the previous act, stopped by the Simpsons’ house (and now his old house) to retrieve some water. He found Marge there — although she was relieved that her husband hadn’t cheated on her intentionally and was literally acting out of his mind, she told him she wouldn’t go back to him. To her, Homer was not only an <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/alcoholic" target="_blank">alcoholic</a>, but also an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Father_absence" target="_blank">absent father</a>; Meg barely even considered him as a father. An emotional Homer promised he would change, but an equally emotional Marge said they had far more important things to address now, and said she needed some time — as Marge Bouvier — to see if she was ready to go back to Mrs. Simpson or make the change final. Homer soon departed their house, telling Marge he loved her — which she also did.</p>

    <p>Later, Lisa gathered as many of the people she could to her house. Among them were Collin, Claire, Milhouse and Nelson — but also other friends of hers, some of whom had made little to no appearances in the story until then, such as Bill (Milhouse’s friend who helped her invade Cristianne’s MacBook in Act 1), <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Janey_Powell" target="_blank">Janey</a> (the closest Lisa has to a best friend in the original show), <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Martin_Prince,_Jr." target="_blank">Martin</a>, and <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Samantha_Stankey" target="_blank">Samantha</a> (Milhouse’s former girlfriend from <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Bart%27s_Friend_Falls_in_Love" target="_blank"><i>Bart’s Friend Falls in Love</i></a>). It’s worth noting that, of these four, Bill is the only one who had an appearance and a speaking role until then; Martin and Samantha had no appearances until this chapter, while Janey is mentioned in chapter 22 (Hospital visit) as “Janey Hagstrom”, one of Lisa’s friends whom she consulted about going to visit Mr. Burns in the hospital or not.</p>

      <figcaption>Kearney wasn’t in this encounter, likely given how many of these he’s been to throughout his life.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>Alongside them, the city’s adults, such as Apu, Carl, Lenny, Manjula, Moe, and many others, were also there. Yet there were others missing, such as Ned, Todd, his girlfriend (soon-to-be wife) Lenna, and the twin sisters Sherri and Terri. Many, many people. There, Lisa tried to summarize the situation and said that she — using her new <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/philanthropic" target="_blank">philanthrophic</a> skills — had used part of her fortune to buy and distribute water to the city’s residents, since the Springfield River was now at least partially contaminated. This surprises a few people, namely Nelson, who, like most of the story’s recurring characters, had no idea where she even got the money:</p>

    <blockquote>— Then you can spread the word… to the rest of the town. Everyone… — Lisa said.<br/>— Okay, hold on. First of all, where did you get the money to buy all that water, sis?<br/><br/>Lisa cuddled Pearl a little more and looked at Nelson.<br/><br/>— I got it from a will. Actually, come to think of it, it felt a lot like <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/poetic_justice" target="_blank">poetic justice</a>. As if Mr. Burns was redeeming himself for a future mistake.<br/>— I don’t know if I understood what…<br/>— We’re not here for that, Nelson. Just say thanks and shut up! — Claire cut him off.<br/><br/><div style="text-align: right">from Chapter 149, “<a href="https://www.spiritfanfiction.com/historia/nao-mais-simpsons-14312693/capitulos/18340422" target="_blank">Water Donation (part 4)</a>”</div></blockquote>

    <p>Bart, seeing Claire so happy with Milhouse, felt sad. He didn’t miss Claire has a person, but he missed the concept of Claire — her body, her mouth, her warmth. And every time he saw the two of them together, he didn’t know whether to be happy or sad, angry or relieved. Sometimes, he felt like she didn’t deserve either of them. And he couldn’t understand why he was thinking of her now, because he thought he had moved on. Confused, a crying Bart got out of the house and ran in the streets — almost being hit by a car in the process. And he soon realized that all his pain wasn’t due to Claire — it was because he felt guilty of the stuff that had happened. He felt like he <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/suicidal_ideation" target="_blank">needed to die</a>, and yet no one was there to comfort him or listen to him. And so he continued running away in the streets; it was getting dark.</p>

    <div class="pull-quote">Why <i>not</i>? Have you seen the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Development_Index" target="_blank">HDI</a> [Human Development Index] here? The crime rates? Education? Of… everything! We’re on the edge of the world, nobody knows Springfield. We’re on par with Brazil here, except worse, because they have raw materials to export.</div>

    <p>Back to Lisa’s house, Martin was telling her that perhaps she was just exaggerating everything; after all, he said, it was the army’s “<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/patriotism" target="_blank">patriotic duty</a> to defend the country”. They weren’t stuck in there, and toxic water was nothing particularly unusual in Springfield. Lisa rebutted him, insisting that he shouldn’t need to be such a <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/kiss-up" target="_blank">kiss-up</a>, and further clarified what she meant. For the military to surround the city with a wall, there were only two explanations for it: either to protect the inside from the things outside, or to lock something inside it. It was simple; they wanted to erase Springfield from the world. And she asked everyone to check their phones — which, as expected, had no signal. But when asked what they could do about it, Lisa was plain and simple: nothing. However, she did tell them to take care and be careful when around some soldiers, as their names and positions would be released the next day. She highlighted a soldier named Hugo, who had killed a 9-year-old boy who was playing hide-and-seek with friends — merely because he was black. This chapter marked the end of the Water Donation pentalogy.</p>

    <p>Two girls on the street end up encountering Bart, who had tripped once again. Did they know him? Of course — everyone knew <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/El_Barto" target="_blank">El Barto</a>. But they were also familiar to him. They were the Mackleberry twins, better known as <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Sherri_Mackleberry" target="_blank">Sherri</a> and <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Terri_Mackleberry" target="_blank">Terri</a>. Bart didn’t recognize them at first, partially because he was recovering from his fall, and partially because they had dyed their hair green. Terri reveals she was the twin who was stalking Bart that day his house was invaded — confirming that Rod’s statement that the girl was Terri was indeed correct — and both girls laugh about seeing Bart naked. It wasn’t a surprise to either; the entire town still recalled the day that photo of him and Cristianne was leaked. After both joked and insinuated that, because they saw Lisa that night with him, that <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/incest" target="_blank">they had a relationship with each other</a>, the two invited Bart to a party they were going to.</p>

    <p>The next chapter brings us to Todd again. He was in his room, begging on his knees for God to bring Ralph back. He’d been there for hours, without eating or drinking anything, which caused a rather worried Ned to show up and see what was happening. After Ned explained that God didn’t always answered their prayers, an outraged Todd lashed out at him, wondering why God was so <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/egoism" target="_blank">egoist</a> and why even pray and follow his teachings if they deserved nothing. With Ned threatening to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanking" target="_blank">spank him</a> if he kept talking like that, he backed down. Though Todd explained he didn’t want Ralph to die, even saying he loved him — causing Ned to correct him, saying he liked, but never <i>loved</i> another boy — Ned advised him to sleep and left the room. Moments later, Todd would look at the Bible on his lamp desk… and rip it into shreds.</p>

    <p>Bart was soon taken by the twins to the party — which was actually a small gathering at the Indelinquents’ abandoned house. Kearney hadn’t arrived yet, and Nelson was in the backyard, so only Jimbo and Dolph were there. Although Jimbo was not happy they sent someone else there, he was alright with Bart’s presence. As Dolph gave everyone there cans of Duff (besides Nelson, who didn’t want to drink because he had work the next day), a rather <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/horny" target="_blank">horny</a> Sherri — which Terri repeatedly insulted in her mind — insinuated Bart was only there to <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/fuck_around" target="_blank">fuck around</a> with everyone, and even asked Dolph if Bart’s presence there made him hard. Although he denied it, Sherri said she and Jimbo already knew it was true — noting that Kearney was dumb enough to understand this —, insinuating <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/gay" target="_blank">he liked men</a>; Dolph even blushed a bit. And Bart, not willing to drink much, just went to the yard outside.</p>

    <p>His actual intentions were to go to the bathroom, but Sherri informed him that there was no <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/toilet" target="_blank">toilet</a> there. He then went to the yard to take a piss, noticing Nelson was there too. They spoke for a moment; Nelson had left Lisa’s meeting hours ago directly to the Indelinquents’ hangout. Nelson even gave him a cigarette; although Bart thought drugs <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_Say_No" target="_blank">were too bad even for him</a>, he accepted it nonetheless, not really liking the smell. Eventually, Nelson asked him about his family — what it was to have a good family, specifically. Bart said he never had a good family; his dad was an alcoholic, his mother was too sensitive, and his sisters weren’t fans of his. This surprised him, who thought it was the opposite, but also said his family wasn’t good either. Nelson’s father, <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Eddie_Muntz" target="_blank">Eddie</a>, was practically unknown to him, and his mother had left Nelson alone by himself. And this worried him.</p>

    <blockquote>Nelson Muntz stared at Bart with watering eyes and asked:<br/><br/>— Do you think my mother will still try to come back, even with this shitty wall? She always comes back and… I… I’m really scared of losing her. Forever…<br/>— I think you should let it go. I mean, I know it’s complicated, since she’s your mother and all. But she never appreciated you and, I don’t know. You get it; I’m not good at this.<br/>— Thanks, Bart Simpson. Let’s go inside.<br/><br/><div style="text-align: right">from Chapter 154, “<a href="https://www.spiritfanfiction.com/historia/nao-mais-simpsons-14312693/capitulos/18431620" target="_blank">Smoking outdoors</a>”</div></blockquote>

    <p>At Ralph’s funeral (at his family’s house), there were a few people gathered there. One of them was Lenna, alongside Ned and Todd. She wasn’t very used to being at funerals like this; she was raised <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinduism" target="_blank">Hindu</a> by her parents, and yet still came to support her boyfriend and the parents of the dead Ralph. Ralph’s coffin was made out of lead — to prevent any contamination —, and was sealed by military recommendations. He wouldn’t be buried, however; he’d need to be cremated. After comforting the wounded Clancy and his wife, <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Sarah_Wiggum" target="_blank">Sarah</a>, she went to comfort the poor Todd. She gave him a <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/salami" target="_blank">salami</a> sandwich and water to eat, which he did. Lenna took him to Ralph’s room so he could sleep a bit, and it was there when he told her that he wanted to die; again, she did her best to comfort him. Todd explained that he loved him, which Lenna said wasn’t a bad thing, but Todd insisted he wasn’t gay and did not want to go to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell" target="_blank">Hell</a>. Suspecting that he was confused and was actually expressing <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/guilt" target="_blank">guilt</a> for not being able to save him, she advised him to go to sleep while she talked to his father. On her way out, Todd called her “mom” — although he was not sure if she heard him.</p>

    <p>The following two chapters are, perhaps, the most interesting in the entire story — to say the least. When Nelson and Bart came back inside, everyone else gathered in a circle and began playing a mix of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_the_bottle">spin the bottle</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_or_dare%3F" target="_blank">truth or dare?</a>. Some of the rules were that any question or challenge was allowed, and that the player could only choose the same option a maximum of three times in a row. For example, someone who picked “truth” three times in a row would necessarily have to pick “dare” at least once. Bart went first, and the mouth of the bottle (specifically a <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/milk_bottle" target="_blank">milk bottle</a>) pointed at Jimbo, who picked dare; Bart dared him to eat a single strand of his hair. Although he didn’t think it was a real dare, he did so with some digust. It was now his turn — after spinning the bottle, it pointed at Terri, who also picked dare. Jimbo dared Terri to give her sister, Sherri, a full-fledged <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_kiss" target="_blank">French kiss</a>, tongue-on-tongue, which she did without hesitation.</p>

    <p>With Terri in charge, the bottle then pointed at her sister Sherri. Yet another dare; she dared her sister to not drink for the rest of the night, bumming her out. When Sherri spun the bottle, it pointed at Bart. Smiling, she dared Bart to <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/group_sex" target="_blank">fuck all of them</a> — each one of them — for 5 minutes each in the street. Alarmed, the others thought it was a lot for Bart — and for them, too! — and Terri decided that her sister was too drunk and decided to take her home. However, Bart — who was still reeling from seeing Claire and Milhouse earlier that day — said he would do it. Nelson even suggested for him to do it only with the twin sisters, as he was <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/heterosexual#English" target="_blank">straight</a>, but he insisted.</p>

    <div class="pull-quote">The situation was a tad comical; Bart had at last stopped being a virgin, and he did it by fucking three boys and then two girls in the middle of the night.</div>

    <p>Jimbo offered him a pack of <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/condom" target="_blank">condoms</a>, and everyone went outside to do it. The streets were practically empty at this time of night, meaning no one would see them. After a long silence, an embarrassed Dolph volunteered himself as tribute, and was the first one that night to be <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/buttfucked" target="_blank">buttfucked</a>. Although somewhat indifferent, Bart was not very satisfied with it. When the five minutes passed, Nelson and Jimbo argued with each other until Nelson gave up and went second. Likewise, Bart was not very satisfied with it, and Nelson did not seem to enjoy it. Jimbo went next, and both felt very similar to how Bart and Nelson felt. When they were finished, Sherri asked Terri to go next, which he did. But unlike the previous three, Bart actually liked it! After the five minutes passed, Sherri rapidly took her spot, to Terri’s disapproval, and they continued. Liking it even more, Bart continued until even after the 5-minute timer had ended — to everyone else’s surprise. Yet they weren’t only surprised at this, however; they were shocked when another person stopped by. It was Kearney, beaten and bruised up.</p>

    <p>The next chapter, from Kearney’s point of view, is intentionally full of grammatical errors. He was in his house with his girlfriend, a woman named Hanney Beller. Hanney was 26 — six years older than Kearney, who the story puts as 20. They had a kid, Keusley (unrelated to Kearney’s two canonical children, <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Kearney_Zzyzwicz,_Jr." target="_blank">Kearney Jr.</a> and <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Kearney%27s_Other_Son" target="_blank">his other son</a>), although this wasn’t public information yet; Kearney never accepted public responsibility for his son, but wanted to do so now. This surprised Hanney, but she was happy about it. When Kearney went out — he had to meet the Indeliquents —, it was about 10 p.m., and it was cold outside. During his route to the abandoned house, he was spotted by one of the soldiers who were patrolling Springfield. It was Hugo who, finding the man suspicious, promptly <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/frisk#Verb" target="_blank">frisked</a> him. After finding a pack of cigarettes and a lighter, he kindly bashed Kearney’s head into a tree.</p>

    <p>Back at the Wiggum Resident on <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/732_Evergreen_Terrace" target="_blank">732 Evergreen Terrace</a>, Lenna was <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/daydream#English" target="_blank">daydreaming</a>. She recalled a moment where she took her daughter, Cristianne, to a fashion store when she was just 6-years-old. Her daughter didn’t really like her dress, but Lenna insisted that it was alright, and that she looked beautiful in it. Seeing she was still upset, she tried to comfort her. Lenna explained that she wanted to see her daughter have success in life. She pointed at her own skin color and explained that people there, in America, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism_in_the_United_States" target="_blank">used to treat them differently due to it</a>, and that she was lucky that she inherited the lighter skin her father had — and that she had to try everything she could to get to the top. Lenna’s daydream eventually moved to another scene, where she was called to the principal’s office in a private school due to something her daughter did. Cristianne was then 8 years old; on the way back home, Lenna was disappointed about something she did, after all her attempts and making sure her daughter fit in. Her daughter (and a friend of hers named Adrielly) was expelled. Before she could think more about it, however, Sarah would interrupt her and ask if she was okay. She was in the hallway, still; her daydream was over. The two went down to the dining room, although Lenna knew that, this time, with Ned and Todd, she had a second chance to make things just right.</p>

    <p>The Springfield POV returns here, in chapter 161, showing what had happened until then. Jefford Freeley had taken over the <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Springfield_Town_Hall" target="_blank">Springfield Town Hall</a>, and was looking over at several files from their archives in shock. Hugo, after beating up a vagabond (Kearney), left for one of the temporary military camps just outside town. Despite being satisfied with this, Hugo would have unspecified nightmares overnight. Bart, after an unexpected sixsome, realized that maybe he was straight after all. He went back home after hearing from Kearney what happened to him, although he kept in touch with Sherri to participate in their next meetings. When he went back home, Marge immediately hugged him; just moments prior, Marge was arguing with Lisa over letting him wander the unsafe streets of town. Collin would come to her defense, explaining that Bart was a <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cynical#English" target="_blank">cynical</a> idiot and that she didn’t need to cover up all his mistakes.</p>

    <p>Eventually, Marge informed them of Ralph’s <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/wake#Etymology_2" target="_blank">wake</a>, and that they would go straight to his house. Lisa invited Collin to go with them; it was at this point that he <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ask_out" target="_blank">asked her out</a> to be his girlfriend. Around the same time, Lenna would talk to Ned about Todd, his son, just outside the Wiggum residence; it would end in a peaceful, heartwarming discussion. Not too far from there, Kearney would go back to his house. His parents, <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Zzyzwicz_Family" target="_blank">Mr. and Mrs. Zzyzwicz</a>, couldn’t care less about him, but his little brother did. His name was Keusley. Keusley soon noticed his bruised appearance and, perhaps being aware of Kearney’s conversation with Hanney earlier that night, asked him if he was really his brother. Moments after this, all clocks in Springfield — with a margin of error of 35 seconds — turned into midnight. (Fun fact: every chapter from 135 to 161 all happened in the same day!) Lots of things would happen; Jeff would throw some folders on the floor, Hugo would wake up from his nightmare, Lenna and Ned would get into an argument, Marge and Bart would avoid talking to each other, and Kearney would say Keusley was indeed his brother. But to Collin, Lisa said yes.</p>

    <blockquote>The new day had begun in the worst possible way. But even in the longest, darkest tunnel, abandoned by men and at the mercy of nature, without any affection or appreciation, nor interest or care… there is a minuscule, teeny, tiny light. There is a way out. Anyone who is lost in this tunnel, or in their own dilemmas, can follow that speck of hope towards the way out of this situation. And if this exit is blocked, all that means is more hard work.<br/><br/>If we know what to do with this scratch, almost invisible to the human eye, it can lead us to a new source of light and warmth. Lisa and Collin felt that spark inside them. Lisa had said yes. And the fire of her love could warm and illuminate everyone else, who was not in the tunnel, but at the bottom of the well.<br/><br/><div style="text-align: right">from Chapter 161, “<a href="https://www.spiritfanfiction.com/historia/nao-mais-simpsons-14312693/capitulos/18544858" target="_blank">A lot of things happening</a>”</div></blockquote>

    <p>A month had passed. Ned and Lenna took Ralph to a <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/psychoanalyst" target="_blank">psychoanalyst</a> named Jessy, whose office was a <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/naphthalene" target="_blank">naphthalene</a>-smelling room he didn’t like much. A whole month later, he still thought about Ralph — how he at times thought he was going to show up to his home, and they’d play together, but he wouldn’t. He was dead. And he loved him. When he told this to Jessy, Ned was immediately enraged and asked him to not use that door; this caused her to ask Ned to leave. She asked the 14-year-old Todd if he’d fallen in love with someone before; he said no. She then asked him what he felt about sex — and if he’d do it if he had the opportunity to, which he also said no. Finally, she asked him if he thought he could fit, among many other categories, in the <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/asexual" target="_blank">asexual</a> category. And after a moment of silence, he nodded yes.</p>

    <p>Hugo, meanwhile, was having a <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/nightmare" target="_blank">nightmare</a>. (It’s not specified if this nightmare was the same nightmare from a month earlier or a similar, newer nightmare.) He’s running from something during a flood, which killed and eaten what looked like the <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Grim_Reaper" target="_blank">Grim Reaper</a>. Eventually, this something — some black light of sorts — caught him and turned him old, weak. And suddenly, he found himself at 8 years old again, recalling his childhood. He lived in a slum (think of the Brazilian <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/favela" target="_blank"><i>favelas</i></a>) with his 21-year-old brother, father, and mother (who was carrying an unborn child). Their house, however, dissipated in the dream and was replaced by a man — a black man — taking off his clothes and grabbing one of the branches in the tree. Hugo called him a monkey.</p>

    <p>He could hear, far away, the siren of a police car where the <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bourgeoisie#English" target="_blank">bourgeoisie</a> lived. He assumed the cops were going after someone who stole a purse. Hugo could also hear the noise of his mother asking him to buy bread for her; in the way, he stumbled across a “fat smoker” who asked him where he was going, and why would a boy like him buy bread all alone. Scared, he ran, ran, and ran, to no avail. By the end of everything, he was lying in an alley, crying. No one came to help him. Although this chapter is written in an intentionally confusing way, one thing is fairly clear: Hugo was <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sexual_abuse" target="_blank">sexually abused</a>.</p>

    <p>In school, Milhouse and Claire sat in class next to each other. Their teacher was a guy named Kallihd (possibly an erroneous misspelling of <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Khalid" target="_blank">Khalid</a>), who was hired by the military. Claire was still uneasy with the military there, but Milhouse explained they’d have to settle in eventually — they’d been there for almost three months! A lot of things had changed in the school system, too; classes were now separated by age, and so anyone who had a birthday would automatically move up a grade. As a result, Bart was now one grade ahead of Lisa. (Up until then, they were in the same grade.) And many of their textbooks were replaced by <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/abridged" target="_blank">abridged</a> versions, with more images than actual text or exercises. When leaving school, the two eventually noticed Bart hanging out with Nelson and the twins, Sherri and Terri. This concerned Claire, but Milhouse did not comment much on it.</p>

    <div class="pull-quote">In the past, she [Lisa] didn’t really like physical touch, but now only the touch of her boyfriend or her mother calmed her insecurity.</div>

    <p>This chapter is followed by the “Wall-Mart Mayhem” duology (an ironic title, given that at no point a Walmart is even mentioned in the story). Over here it’s explained that it had been exactly 3 months and 2 weeks since the military invasion, and food stocks were only refilled the month prior, causing food prices to have tripled (see: <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/supply_and_demand" target="_blank">supply and demand</a>). Lisa, after helping the outskirts of town obtain access to safe water, was at Kwik-E-Mart with Zero, her dog (who was outside), Bart, and also Collin. It was there that Lisa confirmed to Nelson that yes, she and Collin were dating; although she hated making it public at first, only her boyfriend and mother could really comfort her in these tough times. It was then when Hugo entered the establishment, asking to talk to the manager — Apu. He told Apu that he was there to jail him, as his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_license" target="_blank">business license</a> had expired and so had his passport.</p>

    <p>Although Apu kindly explained that he was in fact a <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/naturalization" target="_blank">naturalized</a> American about a decade ago (likely referring to the events of <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Much_Apu_About_Nothing" target="_blank"><i>Much Apu About Nothing</i></a>), Hugo was not satisfied with this answer, and proceeded to beat him up. Bart ran into Apu’s defense but was hit and fell near the cash register. Zero, who was outside, ran into Hugo’s direction and bit his leg, causing it to bleed. Hugo promptly used his <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/nightstick" target="_blank">nightstick</a> at the dog and kicked him, causing Zero to also bleed. While Bart went to check on Zero, Collin got on top of Hugo and Nelson tried his best to hold his arm, all of this while Apu slowly crawled away. It was right at this moment when the Kwik-E-Mart doors opened; it was Mathy — one of Jeff’s subordinates, with a German accent — and he rapidly rebuked Hugo for causing confusion there. Although he tried to defend himself, Mathy told him they hadn’t even collected that region’s “documents” (as in, the data regarding every citizen who lived there), and both left as if nothing happened.</p>

    <p>And after a 30-chapter absence, she’s back! Meg, the one and only. (Brendon even calls her his <a href="https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Daenerys_Targaryen" target="_blank">Daenerys</a>!) She was in a makeshift military camp in the woods, just like many of her fellow students. Meg recalled the conversation she had with Boll months ago, where he explained that Jeff requested his soldiers to help him in a mission. The soldiers, just like the camp structure, followed a strict <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hierarchy" target="_blank">hierarchy</a> where richer and smarter students were on top — including Lexanna, who was labeled as a child prodigy. Going back to her tent, she stumbled upon Lexanna on the way, where they waved hi to each other but didn’t really talk; their relationship hadn’t really recovered since that incident. And Meg had other things to worry about — her parents, the people in Springfield, and also the huge responsibility she had to take care of, as Boll had explicitly told her that <i>she</i> was his biggest weapon — to avoid the genocide of an entire town.</p>

    <p>Lisa, Bart and Marge took the wounded Zero to a veterinarian, Doctor George Marrell (possibly the <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Veterinarian" target="_blank">veterinarian</a> from <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Dog_of_Death" target="_blank">Dog of Death</a>), who said he wished he could do more — and blamed the “so-called colonel Jefford”. He explained that a squadron had recently taken a bunch of his medications, alongside other health clinics, because they were deemed “less important.” However, due to the costs of the invasion, they simply hadn’t prepared to request new shipments. Instead of simply requesting the government for more supplies, they were actually importing them from other foreign countries, such as Canada, China, and Russia. It was then when Lisa explained to him that the reason the shipments were slowly coming in was that they were covering up something — the accident that had happened in the nuclear plant. They wanted to wipe out Springfield from the map. Marell said Zero would need to say in there for a while, but the Simpsons promised to pay as much as they needed to not only help Zero, but also Marrell’s clinic.</p>

    <p>The next chapter is in Springfield’s POV: after almost four months of no internet, Jefford had announced the week prior that it would be returning. However, any mentions to the situation of the city (namely the wall, or the military siege of it) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_censorship" target="_blank">were prohibited</a>. Marge was ecstatic, as she had not been in contact with her ever since it was suspended by Boll, and eventually removed outright. She gathered her family — Bart, Lisa, and also Homer and his father, Abe — to videocall her. (Selma and Patty were invited, but did not show up.) Abe now lived with Homer, and was basically living off a monthly <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pension" target="_blank">pension</a> paid by Lisa. Lisa, in fact, had been doing a lot — not only to fund the poor in need, but to also make sure clinics, hospitals, schools, etc. were under working condition, and also to make sure local producers were producing enough food for the city. She was essentially their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_President" target="_blank">Shadow President</a>.</p>

    <p>Their surprise was that when calling Meg, instead they were met by Boll, who said he’d tell Meg that they called, and quit the voicecall. The rest of the family went downstairs, enraged, shouting all sorts of <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/epithet" target="_blank">epithets</a> at him and the military members who invaded the town. In the midst of this, Lisa would tell a bandaged Bart that she’d just received an email — from the same girl that had warned them about Sideshow Bob in Act 2. (Though Lisa does not mention Lexanna’s name, she would’ve most likely known this as the email Bart received was from Lexanna’s personal account. Curiously, it seems neither of them had any contact after that message was sent, although any contact would’ve been brief given how a week later, the power plant incident occured.) As seen below:</p>

    <blockquote>“Hello!<br/><br/>I’m sending this message randomly to random people… it just so happens that I recently read a magnificent book saga! But I have no one to talk to… ;-;<br/><br/>The books are called ‘<a href="https://snicket.fandom.com/wiki/A_Series_of_Unfortunate_Events" target="_blank">A Series of Unfortunate Events</a>’, you know… but my favorite is the spin-off: <a href="https://snicket.fandom.com/wiki/Lemony_Snicket:_The_Unauthorized_Autobiography" target="_blank">The Unauthorized Autobiography.</a><br/><br/>Anyway… I’d be very much delighted if you, whoever you are, would read and reply to me so that we could become friends.<br/><br/>Seriously, they’re short books… if you start as soon as you wake up, you’ll be finished before the bells ring in the afternoon; the books tell of the tragic and ill-fated adventures of the Baudelaires, whom we know live under the claws of Olaf, the Count of a nasty troupe.

    <p>The next chapter is through the point of view of Rod, Flanders’ eldest son. He was not in Worcester or anywhere near Massachusetts, however; he was actually in a <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/motel" target="_blank">motel</a> near a major highway, getting bitten by many <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/mosquito#English" target="_blank">along the way</a>. (He was also naked, which didn’t help.) Rod was headed to Springfield, sensing that something was wrong. The military had apparently said the city had gone through a <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cholera" target="_blank">cholera</a> outbreak, and that access/communications to the city were limited. However, Rod knew his dad was a <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/germophobia" target="_blank">germophobe</a> at heart, being less likely to be infected, and realized that the city had been pretty much locked for five months — even though such an outbreak would not last long in normal circumstances. (Medically, cholera outbreaks don’t typically drag on for months in a single location unless there’s a persistent contamination source (e.g., a polluted water supply) and no effective response.)</p>

    <p>Fearing for his family’s safety, he left his girlfriend at Worecester — leading to a fight and causing her to move to her <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/roommate" target="_blank">roommate</a>’s studio apartment — and traveled back to Springfield. About 10 km (6.2 miles) away from the city, he was stopped by a convoy of military trucks and had to turn back. Now stuck in that motel, he went outside to take a smoke — while naked — yet went back inside after he noticed a young woman also there, which made him, guess it, very very excited. (According to all known laws of cultural Brendonism &amp; the Brendonian sex theory, this is a common occurrence in the story.) She was not very excited, barging in his room door and grabbing him — saying that if he was gonna take it off, he’d need to do it <i>outside</i>. Moments after this, the very distraught woman began complaining about Rod. This woman was, in fact, Bart’s first childhood crush, <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Laura_Powers" target="_blank">Laura Powers</a>, who was briefly mentioned in Act 1.</p>

    <p>Understandably, she was disgusted by the experience and even told him that <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sexual_harassment" target="_blank">sexual harassment</a> was a crime, going inside her motel room. A moment later, however, Rod — who went from banging to just lightly knocking at the door — realized what he was doing and apologized, causing her to cry and eventually open the door for him. She hated the situation she was in; she’d left Springfield and her son to get away from religious nutjobs and <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/WASP" target="_blank">WASPs</a>. After hearing from Rod that he was going back to Springfield, she eventually asked if she could take him there; he agreed.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile, Marge was at a restaurant. She’d gone there to avoid seeing her soon-to-be ex-husband Homer at Moe’s, and asked for an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_cream_float" target="_blank">ice cream float</a>, with also a bit of whiskey — a big feat for her, considering she hadn’t had alcohol in a long while. It was there that one particularly good-looking man began flirting with her, to little avail, as Marge was uninterested in him. He did point out to her that she was still wearing her <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/wedding_ring" target="_blank">wedding ring</a> and was unsure if she wanted to talk. Knowing that it was time to leave Marge Simpson in the past, Marge Bouvier agreed to go out to him. The guy, called Ross Backer, told her his apartment was just a few blocks away, and he was freshly single after a 3-year relationship with another man. Marge, still somewhat disinterested, went along.</p>

    <div class="pull-quote">— Collin, shut up for once in your life! <i>Fucking hell.</i></div>

    <p>The remaining Bouvier family members were with Collin at their house, when Bart went upstairs to take a bath. Collin would knock on the door, telling Bart that he and others were worried about him, especially his relationship with the Indelinquents. Bart, after taking him inside and shutting the door, promptly told Collin that he was just going to <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/get_laid" target="_blank">get laid</a> with just <i>one</i> of them, told him that he could just go along with him instead of doing Lisa’s tasks, and called him a “<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/narcissistic" target="_blank">narcissistic</a> asshole who judges supposedly inferior people,” such as his friends. Despite his insistence that it was <i>them</i> — and not the friends he was hanging out with — that cared about him, Bart brushed it off and, as he went downstairs, told Collin to go to hell, calling him a <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/preppy" target="_blank">preppy</a>.</p>

    </figure>

    <p>Terri, one of the twins, had just finished leaving a <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/drugstore" target="_blank">drugstore</a>. She’d just brought something, despite the shelves being almost empty and the prices having multiplied by five. On her way home, she met Bart — by sheer coincidence, as Sherri had called him to their home, and so they went together. At this point, Terri’s hair had gone back to her natural brown color. She left Bart in her room, as she went to give Terri the product she’d bought. Her home was practically empty; their parents worked 24/7 and it was hard to see them even once. When Sherri finally left the bathroom, she was in tears, and Terri knew what was going on. Bart, just behind them, was confused, but after she hugged her sister, she extended something to Bart. It was a <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pregnancy_test" target="_blank">pregnancy test</a>. It came out positive.</p>

    <p>Almost devastated, Sherri told Bart that she’d have to assume that responsibility. He agreed, telling her that he would be the best father for the kid — causing Sherri to lash out at him. Sherri, who was 16, didn’t want to deal with that <i>thing</i> — and told him upfront that she would <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/abortion" target="_blank">abort</a> it. (Note: assuming this story happens at any point between 2018 and April 2020, where this chapter was released, this would be possible either by: having a signed consent from one of her parents (and that the other parent must be aware), or via a judicial bypass, which would be the most likely option here. See <a href="https://law.justia.com/codes/missouri/2018/title-xii/chapter-188/" target="_blank">Missouri Revised Statutes, Chapter 188</a>.) Although Bart was horrified, not understanding how she could want to get rid of her own child, Sherri soon clarified:</p>

    <blockquote>— You’d never understand… — she said, starting to cry again — You’re a man! You’re practically an adult! You have people to support you! Put yourself in my shoes! How am I going to be treated? A young, pregnant girl… the slut who couldn’t control herself and went out screwing whoever came along! The whore who only came into this world to smear her family’s reputation! But you would never understand that, because it’s different with you. It’s always different with men! Look, he lost his virginity early, he’s already picking up women… oh, that’s a real man. That’s my boy! And, look, he’s decided to do literally THE LEAST he could do and take on the child. He’s an example of a person! Poor guy, having a child so young must be hard… But not for the girl. Who cares if it ruins her future or the pain she’ll go through? Who told her to spread her legs? I bet she’ll give a hard time as a wife! Poor father of that child, who will have to put up with her… it’s a shame… that… that…<br/><br/>Sherri couldn’t finish; she cried non-stop and found it hard to breathe. Bart remained silent, and Terri comforted her with her touch.<br/><br/><div style="text-align: right">from Chapter 175, “<a href="https://www.spiritfanfiction.com/historia/nao-mais-simpsons-14312693/capitulos/19118581" target="_blank">Schrödinger’s Baby</a>”</div></blockquote>

    <p>Bart, agreeing that it was up to her after all (even though he disagreed with her idea), left their house. Meanwhile, Rod and Laura were deep within the woods, following a path that Rod said would take it to the city. He explained to her — after being hit by a branch — that when he was younger, he and his friends would do this a lot to get out of the city and that his life wasn’t easy, causing Laura to call him a <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/vagabond" target="_blank">vagabond</a> (in Brazil, this word is usually used as a synonym for crappy or worthless), not believing him. Irritated, Rod told her that while things were fine at first, after his mother <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Maude_Flanders" target="_blank">Maude</a> <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Alone_Again,_Natura-Diddily" target="_blank">died</a>, his father became a religious nutjob (a reference to Ned’s actual evolution in the series over the years, leading to the term <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization" target="_blank">flanderization</a>) and realized that, during his own process of self-discovery and experimentation, he’d forgotten that society had rules that needed to be followed. He wasn’t coming back for Ned, though; he was coming bad for Todd, his younger brother, who had been <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/whip#English" target="_blank">whipped</a> much more than he had, and so felt constrained within his own father’s reach.</p>

    <p>Laura, seeming to understand the situation better, told him — while she shed many tears — that she knew how he felt. When she was her age, she did a lot of these things, and when she turned 18, she started dating a boy (who eventually became her husband), and would grow on to despise him. When she revealed she was pregnant to him, he abandoned her. Only months later would he appear, trying to <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/blackmail" target="_blank">blackmail</a> her for money; otherwise, he’d report her for not caring about their child, one-year-old Andrew. Her goal was to go back to Springfield and start off a new life, until eventually going back to her son. Even though her mother (that’s <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Ruth_Powers" target="_blank">Ruth Powers</a>) was taking care of him, she still missed him.</p>

    <p>Not too far from there, Meg was spying at a military camp not too far from her, hidden in a tree. She was incredibly bored, with nothing important going on there for days, and kept reflecting back to the conversation she had with Boll on that fateful day. He spoke about hating getting close to people unnecessarily — and, recalling how apparently some of his superiors wanted to <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/powerwash" target="_blank">powerwash</a> Springfield out of existence, he disagreed. Perhaps, he thought, <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole" target="_blank">they should just twist the knife the enemy had given them</a>. But it was at this point that Meg, sensing two people near her and Lexanna’s makeshift camp, ran away to warn her. These people were Laura and Rod, who were running away from the other military camp so they wouldn’t be caught. While running, they stopped for a moment to check on Rod, who got a cut from one of the tree branches. While Laura inspected him, however, Rod unexpectedly kissed her in the mouth — causing her to slap him. He thought they were in the mood for it, but they were not. It was at this point when Meg, realizing who was there, called out for both.</p>

    <p>Chapter 179 returns to the Springfield POV. This time, we’re taken to Bart, who’s just returned home. His sister Lisa was reading the 12th book of <i>A Series of Unfortunate Events</i>, <a href="https://snicket.fandom.com/wiki/The_Penultimate_Peril" target="_blank">The Penultimate Peril</a>. There, Bart told his mother that he had just gotten a girl pregnant, to Marge’s shock. She was horrified, however, when Bart told her that she was going to abort the baby — causing her to rant about how unacceptable that was. The sun was setting. A bit far from there, Homer drank at Moe’s. Much farther from there, Meg and Lexanna spoke to Laura and Rod about what had happened, and Lexanna noted she emailed Lisa (but got no response), and was unsure if she even got her message. It was then when Rod suggested for him and Laura to <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/infiltrate" target="_blank">infiltrate</a> the military. Though Laura was skeptical, Lexanna said she liked the idea, although it’d be hard, but possible. Back to the Bouvier/Simpson house, Marge argued with Bart about the fate of his and Sherri’s unborn child, but after telling her mother that it was up to Sherri and not to him, she gave up. Right after that, Lisa, unexpectedly, slapped Bart hard on the face — telling him to reflect on what he’d done. She then went to grab some ice in the kitchen; her hands were now burning.</p>

    <p>At Moe’s, Homer was drinking his 15th jar of <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/beer" target="_blank">beer</a> while Moe reflected on everything going on. Just like elsewhere, prices had gone up significantly in his own store, and now clients had to give him the money before receiving their desired beverage. Moe asked Homer how things were, worried about Meg; it had been six months or more since the last time they had spoken! He told him, however, that he was spending time away from Marge so she could see he had changed (to Moe’s skepticism), and said he only really had Moe and his father, Abe, to help him now. Moe recalled that, thanks to one of Jeff’s orders, all asylum, hospital and orphanage “inmates” that were not under a serious/terminal condition were to be laid off and sent elsewhere, as part of their <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/austerity" target="_blank">cost-cutting measures</a>. Despite not liking how he was just giving drinks to Homer and letting him be, he still cared about him; after all, it’s not like he had many people to help nowadays.</p>

    <p>The next chapter is through Rod’s point of view. Or rather, Rodric — who’s a new character. He, as one of the military soldiers, recalled patrolling an area of Springfield’s woods, alongside a girl, when another girl came in <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LittleMissBadass" target="_blank">and kicked their asses</a>. As he slowly woke up, he realized the girl — his fellow soldier, Ann Brie — was half-naked and tied up to his back. After wondering what the hell was going on, the very same girl came in with a clean pair of clothes and promised to untie them, while also asking them to listen and cooperate with them.</p>

    <p>That chapter is followed up by chapter 182, part of a 3-chapter saga called Undercover. A week or so had passed, and although Ann Brie was somewhat uncomfortable with Laura’s presence, she was glad that she and Rod found Meg and Lexanna. For starters, Rod’s plan worked; Meg essentially <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/scout#English" target="_blank">scouted</a> the group for a few days, which Ann Brie when she heard about it, as she was worried about her age — she had to be 11 at most — but everything went well. (In fact, Meg had prior experience with this, and she would later recall to her the events that would lead to Cristianne’s exposé and eventual suicide in Act 1.) And more stuff occurred:</p>

    <blockquote>From there came Meg’s next fear. The initial stage of the plan consisted of kidnapping two soldiers about her age, new to the camp, relatively unknown, with the lowest possible rank, yet high enough to have unrestricted access to enter and leave the city. Again: Meg was just a little girl, in the prime of her 9 or 10 years!<br/><br/>And again: Laura’s fear proved to be unfounded, because she had single-handedly — despite her own and Rod’s protests — knocked out two soldiers of considerably higher rank and arguably greater age. Of course, there were many circumstances to consider, such as the <a href="en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surprise_factor" target="_blank">surprise factor</a>, but it was still almost superhuman.<br/><br/><div style="text-align: right">from Chapter 182, “<a href="https://www.spiritfanfiction.com/historia/nao-mais-simpsons-14312693/capitulos/19359112" target="_blank">Undercover (One)</a>”</div></blockquote>

    <p>All being said and done, Rod and Laura, now with their uniforms and <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/identity_card" target="_blank">identity cards</a>, went straight to the military camp during a shift change. They eventually went to Rodric’s tent; from now on, they were Rodric and Ann Brie. The tent was small, maybe 3 m³ at most, and it was hard to adjust at first. For the first few days, Rod had a harder time adjusting compared to Laura (or so he thought), and after the two were seen together by a guard, they decided to stay mostly apart. The next two weeks went fairly well, though by the third week, a guy named Hector stopped by his tent, saying he’d been missing for weeks. Rod made up the excuse that the guy behind him, also named Rodric, left, and was replaced by an identical clone of the same age, 22 — which Hector believed in. Eventually, Hector introduced him to a few of the other soldiers, particularly the girls, who broke the rules a lot without any consequence. He wondered how she was doing; although he liked her, he was not going to focus on it as much. Right now, he was enjoying his new <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/polygamist" target="_blank">polygamist</a> lifestyle; <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/fuck_around#English" target="_blank">he had sex 2 to 3 times a day, all of this *without* repeating the same partner</a>. (This is assuming that Rod has 2–3 encounters per day with one girl each day, and each day features a different girl, leading to Rod having sex with approximately 7 different girls in a week. This number may be smaller.)</p>

    <p>Laura, despite the initial difficulty at being Ann Brie, had fared much better; it turns out the girl had few friends to begin with, which made her upset, and away from Rod, she spent most of the time reading the books that the real Ann Brie had taken with her. After an entire month of being in disguise, she volunteered (and was selected) to help carry a shipment of <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/drinking_water" target="_blank">drinking water</a>, food, and medicinal supplies to Springfield. Rod did the same — and while they saw each other, they pretended to be unaware that they knew each other. Eventually, they embarked on a truck with a capacity of about 7 people.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile, in Springfield, Homer complained to his father, Abe, that they had nothing to eat; Abe, of course, blamed his son’s drinking habits for their little money. Though Homer said he was trying to get a job and things were hard, Abe outright said he didn’t know how such a thing came out of him — referring to his relationship with Homer’s late mother, <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Mona_Simpson" target="_blank">Mona Simpson</a>, which offended Homer, saying that his mom ran away because of <i>him</i>. Abe countered by explaining that Mona, who was part of a “feminist gang”, gave him no choice, and that Homer would’ve understood if he was a <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/war_veteran" target="_blank">war veteran</a> like him. And outraged, Homer began lashing out at him — saying he never served in any war and that he had been so consumed in his lies that they became real to him; that he was always a terrible person and was never close to him as a child; and that he only spent his time drinking at Moe’s instead of spending time with Bart, Lisa, Meg, and Marge. Realizing the last part fit him more than it fit his father, Homer kneeled and cried, leading to Abe comforting him.</p>

    <div class="pull-quote">— They put us on our own. — Lisa took Manjula’s hand. — The greatest act of rebellion now is to stick together.</div>

    <p>Not too far from there, Apu had finally been discharged from the <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Springfield_General_Hospital" target="_blank">Springfield General Hospital</a> after a long two months and was met by his wife, Manjula, and also Bart, Lisa, and their dog, Zero. He thanked the Simpsons for their help, especially in paying for all the treatment costs. Lisa said it was okay, since they were all helping everyone, too — and while it took just as long for Zero to get better, he was much better now. Apu soon heard that the story of his beating traveled fast through the city — although the other, non-Hugo officials did their best to shut most of it down. When he asked about the Octuplets, he found out they were being taken care of by Marge, Lenna, and Sarah, Clancy’s wife; Lisa told him that it was best if they stuck together. It’s worth nothing that according to this chapter (186)’s notes, this chapter was supposed to happen much later in the story, but Brendon anticipated it in light of recent events; this chapter was released on June 1, 2020, and on the prior day, Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro (whom character Boll is somewhat based on) participated in an <a href="https://g1.globo.com/politica/noticia/2020/05/31/manifestantes-fazem-ato-em-brasilia-em-apoio-a-bolsonaro-e-em-defesa-de-medidas-inconstitucionais.ghtml" target="_blank">anti-democracy protest spearheaded by his own supporters</a>.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile, Jefford had called Hugo into a meeting. They were in the office that not too long ago belonged to Springfield’s mayor, <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Joe_Quimby" target="_blank">Joe Quimby</a>. Jefford was livid; he handed Hugo a series of papers with information they had to clear from the streets, all of them about his unlawful behavior. Hugo, who was never a fan of Jeff, said he should’ve been thanking <i>him</i> instead, pointing out that he was clearing the streets from the “monkeys, whales, whores, and vagabonds”, noting that the excessive <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bureaucracy" target="_blank">bureaucracy</a> was not in favor of “good citizens” like him, and that unlike Jeff, he didn’t need to sit in his chair like a lazy bum. Jeff interrupted and warned him, saying that the next time he used his position of power to practice his “shitty actions,” there would be no one to defend him. He promptly put the papers back in the desk drawer and told Hugo that he would not be afraid to take his statements and actions to court.</p>

    <p>And back at the makeshift camp, Ann Brie hated the time she was spending there, particularly because everyone else was just silent. She barely knew Rodric, and noticed Meg and Lexanna avoided talking to each other unless strictly necessary. Though Rodric thought of escaping and <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/denounce#English" target="_blank">denouncing</a> them to the military, they gave up on that idea because they would gain nothing from it. One day, she asked Meg if she had anyone inside Springfield that she knew or was scared about, though Meg was dismissive. After some insistence, she did say she had no friends — not anymore — causing Ann Brie to tell her that she had lots of friends at the camp. Ann Brie even said that she understood Meg’s nuance on the subject because, in her opinion, Meg had a <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/butch#Noun" target="_blank">butch</a> style, stating that straight people like her would usually back off when someone flirted with them, only before abruptly cutting herself mid-statement — instead telling Meg to ignore everything she’d just said, and suggesting that she just make amends with the person she was likely referring to or make new friends. Not happy at all, Meg told her outright that her so-called military friends hadn’t even noticed that she’d been replaced, and stomped off.</p>

    <p>The Springfield POV returns on chapter 189 (Spy Networks), where Lisa is patiently waiting for her brother to leave school. Other things are going on; Sherri and Terri, who were walking through the corridor, didn’t stare at her; Collin would later go on to hug his girlfriend; Todd closed his locker; and Nelson threw a cigarette in the toilet and flushed it. The biggest event that day, however, was the appearance of both Rod and Laura, now in Springfield and united with everyone. Laura told Lisa that Meg had sent her a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_message" target="_blank">hidden message</a> by email, which Lisa said she was trying to discover.</p>

    <p>After a long absence, the next chapter has appearances from both Carl and Lenny. Carl was watching TV — but it was boring because only one local TV channel was left, and the only thing they’d been talking about for months was about the <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Springfield_Mafia" target="_blank">Springfield Mafia</a> and their leader, <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Fat_Tony" target="_blank">Fat Tony</a>. After both of them got dressed and left their apartment, they went down for a walk and ended up just one sidewalk away from Moe’s. While they were doing so, Carl began playing with Lenny, saying they’d be in for another round if they found out Homer was drinking at Moe’s. It was at this point that Carl was hit by something, or rather someone: Hugo.</p>

    <p>The thing is that, just inside the bar, Homer had watched everything, in shock. Moe, too. On the other side, Hugo tried to defend himself, saying that Carl was going to <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/rape" target="_blank">rape</a> Lenny, to which he said no, because Carl was his boyfriend. After calling him a slur, Hugo left — though not before punching Lenny in the face —, and so he decided that they were both going to report him. Though they were skeptical of this, since few people would believe them, they were surprised when Homer, who saw the entire ordeal, told both that he had <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/recorded" target="_blank">recorded</a> the entire thing using his phone.</p>

    <p>A while later, Rod and Laura are now at the old City Hall, specifically the Mayor’s office. They were sent there by Lisa and were looking for something:</p>

    <blockquote>— Don’t you find this idea of Lisa’s a bit, I don’t know, extreme? — he whispered.<br/><br/>— I do, but at this point Springfield is living in a classic dystopia, — Laura replied, opening another drawer in the cupboard— and after a while you stop questioning the Simpsons. I don’t think they’re governed by the same laws of physics as we are.<br/><br/><div style="text-align: right">from Chapter 192, “<a href="https://www.spiritfanfiction.com/historia/nao-mais-simpsons-14312693/capitulos/20328026" target="_blank">Fake Bottom</a>”</div></blockquote>

    <p>They were rummaging through several files, although they hadn’t yet located the one they were looking for. Rod in particular was worried, because he wasn’t sure if Lexanna’s <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/information_technology" target="_blank">IT</a> skills would help them much in this case. Eventually, Laura rummaged through one of the drawers and heard a *click*, opening a secret drawer; though she didn’t know of this, she suspected that Mayor Quimby would want to conceal <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Joe_Quimby#Womanizing_ways" target="_blank">his extramarital affairs</a> from everyone. As Rod hid the files within his <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/fatigues#English" target="_blank">fatigues</a>, an officer came into the building.</p>

    <p>A quick intermission: the next chapter is from the POV of Maryllen (an alternate version of <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Marilyn" target="_blank">Marilyn</a>), who was in some sort of control room, and rather worried about two things. One of them was that Jefford Freeley was coming to visit her; the other reason was that all cameras in the control room were shut down, pitch black, every single one of them, and despite her 7 years of experience in <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/computing#English" target="_blank">computing</a>, nothing she did fixed this. When Jefford came in, amidst the blur that was going on in her mind, he advised her to just call one of the army’s technicians and advised her to not send him there for such "futile" reasons. She realized she needed to drink some water and then follow his instructions as soon as possible.</p>

    <p>When Laura heard the person coming in through the door, she unexpectedly kissed Rod (a <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/stage_kiss" target="_blank">stage kiss</a>, in specific) and advised him to follow along. When they turned to face the officer, they realized it was Hugo — perhaps the scariest officer of all military officers there. Though he said he could just <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/exonerate" target="_blank">exonerate</a> them for such behavior, he understood it because he knew it was something teenagers would do. He dismissed them, though not without asking for their IDs, which they lacked; they did give him their names, however, and promptly left. Though Rod thought Hugo was fooled, Laura thought they didn’t fool, and so both needed to get to Lisa as fast as they could.</p>

    <p>Lisa, given how fast everything was evolving, also knew she needed to get things moving. Given how the only local TV channel in Springfield talked about <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Springfield_Mafia" target="_blank">Springfield Mafia</a> and their leader, <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Fat_Tony" target="_blank">Fat Tony</a>, almost 24/7, she logically realized that they must’ve had some form of outside access, and thus the reason for the crackdown on them. Therefore, she needed to get in touch with their leader. After consulting with Nelson, who was already unsure, she got in touch with Kearney, who was much more unwilling to help, and only acquiesced after much convincing from both Bart and Nelson — and only because he really hated Hugo. Kearney took Lisa to an old bar, originally used by the mafia to train/announce new members. There, after being taken by another Mafia guy inside, she felt something weird — something cold, solid — in the back of her head, heard a loud noise, and felt her conscience waning.</p>

    <div class="pull-quote">— […] Since this is already a shitty dictatorship, at least don’t be the Nazis!</div>

    <p>The next scene showed Jeff being guided by his secretary to a rather enraged couple, Lenny and Carl. However, Jeff didn’t see the two, or rather, his brain didn’t, instead seeing his parents — Pierre and Kai — in front of him. Their voices were different, too, but the resemblances were there (see: <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/deja-vu-psychology" target="_blank">déjà vu</a>). Carl explained that they were attacked by Hugo, and while a rather reserved Jeff said these were serious accusations, he soon told him that a friend of theirs had recorded everything. Jeff remained skeptical, however, causing Carl to tell him that, since they were already under a dictatorship, at least they didn’t be like the Nazis.</p>

    <p>We then experience a flashback of shorts — from the POV of Jeff. When younger, he was raised in a lower-class neighborhood in a city in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_United_States" target="_blank">southern United States</a> by two parents he, admittedly, barely recalled and hadn’t met when he grew older. His house was falling into pieces, and he suffered from <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/malnutrition" target="_blank">malnutrition</a>. The only other boy that was his friend was some kid named Hugo — who was somehow even more aggressive than his adult counterpart. At some point, likely due to parental neglect, Jeff was taken by social services and eventually adopted and raised by two <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_adoption" target="_blank">same-sex partners</a>, two men named Kai and Pierre. He would only meet Hugo again years later, in the military, and he felt the boy still resented him.</p>

    <p>One of them was black, just like him. The other one was <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Jewish" target="_blank">Jewish</a>, albeit with both <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/German">German</a> and <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Mexican">Mexican</a> ancestry. And they were the greatest parents — the greatest dads — he could ever ask for. After five years, however, the three had to move out to another state after Kai had suffered a <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hate_crime" target="_blank">hate crime</a>. On the way to their new home, Pierre explained to Jeff (whom they called “little one”) that thanks to <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Yahweh" target="_blank">Yahweh</a> nothing happened, and that it could’ve been worse. He explained to his child about the tragedies and events that his parents and grandparents faced during the <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/World_War_II" target="_blank">Second World War</a>. Not only this led to Jeff eventually studying Law in the future, but it also shocked him that, in the present, he saw two people who vaguely reminded him of his parents complaining about the things they also used to complain about. It was unnerving.</p>

    <p>Back to Lisa, we find out she had only passed out after the sound of the door locking behind her; awake and sound, she realized she was not in front of Fat Tony. Tony told her that he only agreed to talk to her because she was <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Selma_Bouvier" target="_blank">Selma</a>’s niece, nothing as well that she was famous in town for having killed Mr. Terwilliger, a.k.a. Sideshow Bob. She asked him if he was the one who got Apu a fake passport a few years back (indicating that this is how Apu was before he became a naturalized American), and realized that she may have wanted passports for her entire family to get out of Springfield. To this surprise, however, she didn’t wanna get her family out of the town; she also wanted to get <i>the entire town</i> out of Springfield.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile, at the makeshift camp, Meg came back from yet another mission, which included retrieving a <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/flash_drive" target="_blank">flash drive</a> from the military camp. However, she threw it at Lexanna with such force that it hit her cheeks, making a small cut. With Meg not saying a word, this led to Lexanna having a breakdown — people didn’t like her, and not even her former best friend treated her with respect anymore. Meg tried to explain that she, unlike her, was <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/heterosexuality" target="_blank">straight</a>, and didn’t share feelings for her; this caused Lexanna to sob harder and eventually lash out at her, saying that she had no romantic interest in her, and outright telling Meg that she wasn’t so worried about her liking girls, but about the fact people like her were, in Meg’s conception, wild, incontrollable, or ready to abuse others, which was not true.</p>

    <p>Lexanna told Meg her own story: she, a 12-year-old girl, had a father that she described as a “pastor of a small country town that has stagnated in the medieval age,” and nothing that she was severly punished — usually physically — for her behavior, which she described as non-<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/heteronormative">heteronormative</a>. One of these punishments involved standing on her knees on top of <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/corn" target="_blank">corn</a>, and another one involved her hands being cut by many, many slaps of a <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ferule" target="_blank">ferule</a>. Because of this, she did her best to study hard and, when she got an opportunity to go to the Jefferson City military school, she didn’t think twice; it was a way to get rid of her parents, as she couldn’t stand then anymore. And because of how much she studied, she made virtually no friends there. Except for Meg.</p>

    <div class="pull-quote">— […] I had no idea how people became friends, so I took the obvious route and… asked. And you became my friend! Then you found out that I’m a lesbian, and I realized that all my fears were well-founded. My only best friend did what I feared the most. After that, I knew for sure that the problem was really with me.</div>

    <p>To her, Meg was the <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/best_friend" target="_blank">best friend</a> she needed all this time, someone who could understand her, her idol. And yet when Meg separated from her after discovering her sexuality, Lexanna realized that her biggest fear — that she would have no friends — would come true, and it did. The problem wasn’t Meg, it was her. A shocked Meg tried to apologize, but both were interrupted by Ann Brie, who rushed in with a hand on her now-bloodied jaw.</p>

    <p>Back to Lisa, after some thinking, Fat Tony agreed to her demands. It was a lot of money he’d be receiving, and even though he never imagined he’d do deals with a little girl, he agreed to it and extended his hand. However, before Lisa shaked his hand, there was a <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ringing" target="_blank">ringing</a> sound in the room; Lisa’s own phone. She froze, and Tony’s guards began grabbing their guns — one of them even said he knew something wrong was going on — but Tony just instructed Lisa to attend the phone. It was Lexanna; the fact she was calling even with the possibility of the army intercepting the call was bad. She picked it up, and Lexanna was upfront: Rodric had escaped from the camp and Meg was unable to catch him, and he was taken into custody soon after by some officers. She told Lisa that if she wanted to escape from Springfield, now would be the time to do it.</p>

    <p>The next scene shows Hugo talking to Jeff. He wanted to tell him about something he heard about two new army recruits, but Jeff is not willing to listen. Another army soldier entered the <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/barracks" target="_blank">barracks</a> they were in, and explained that one civilian was caught that day and knew several bits of information about their plan — and wanted to escape Springfield. Hugo began explaining that he met two soldiers that day, Ann Brie and Rodric, without identification, but as soon as Jeff realized this happened hours ago, he, outraged, declared Hugo’s arrest for his war crimes and abuse of authority, while also telling the other soldier to stand by, have the others surround the walls, be prepared for an uprising and, if necessary, <i>kill</i>.</p>

    <p>It didn’t take long for the news to reach the rest of Springfield. As officers and soldiers filled the streets, Moe closed his bar and grabbed a shotgun, as Barney saw all the beer he was drinking slip away from the cup. Claire and Milhouse wondered what was going on, and in the other side of town, Jeff attempted to interrogate Rodric — the real one, that is. And at the barn, Lisa and Fat Tony soon found themselves being raided. Tony handed Lisa a <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pistol" target="_blank">pistol</a>, to which she said didn’t know how to handle one. (In the show, Lisa is notoriously pro-gun control; for example, in <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Treehouse_of_Horror_XIII" target="_blank">Treehouse of Horror XIII</a>, she goes on a gun control crusade.) Explaining that, since Lisa was such a prodigy, she might as well learn it now.</p>

    <p>Back in Squabbletown, Frink Junior Junior (Grandson!) set aside his 1:100,000 <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/scale_model">scale model</a> of a drill he was building for school to stare at a small butterfly flying outside his window. However, his laptop was insistently beeping with a video call. When he finally answered it, he saw a black girl with round glasses and a snub nose. He recognizes her but can’t remember her name. She says she needs his help — their plan has to be put into action now, telling him he owned something to the city of Springfield. Grandson is confused, and though he recalls making some kind of promise, he isn’t sure when or what it was. Either way, he agreed to help. After finally remembering her name, Lexanna, he asked her what he needed to do. (Psst: this part… does not make much sense, technically. In the story, Grandson personally met Lisa, but here he is shown as having known Lexanna, despite the fact neither of them have met personally. While you could say Lisa told Grandson about Lexanna, given how they only met by the time communications in Springfield were being closely monitored, it’s unknown how this would’ve developed.)</p>

    <p>The next scene takes us to the <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Springfield_Police_Station" target="_blank">Springfield Police Station</a>. There, police chief Clancy Wiggum rapidly finds himself surrounded by several armed men from Jefford’s squadron. One of the men, a <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sexagenarian#English">sexagenarian</a>, told him his services would not be needed, as the city was under a <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/state_of_siege">state of siege</a> and thus Jeff would take care of everything. Clancy, however, was opposed to this, however, and outright told the officer that he was, in fact, questioning Jefford’s authority. With the other men aiming their guns at him, he did the same — and did not give in:</p>

    <blockquote>Clancy saw his life in flashes — his childhood, his marriage, his police training, and his career as a terrible professional…<br/><br/>— I’ve got the guts to die for the well-being of the people I love. And you? Do you have the guts to die for a dictator?<br/><br/>…and the day his son was born, the most precious thing in his life. He pulled the trigger and was riddled with dozens of bullets a second later, wearing a peaceful smile. Perhaps, in the darkness clouding his eyes and the numbness enveloping his body, maybe — just maybe — he could see his little Ralph one last time.<br/><br/><div style="text-align: right">from Chapter 204, “<a href="https://www.spiritfanfiction.com/historia/nao-mais-simpsons-14312693/capitulos/21927018" target="_blank">State of Siege</a>”</div></blockquote>

    <p>Meanwhile, Lisa and Fat Tony continued their escape. She was too afraid to use the gun she’d been given, although Tony’s forces kept her mostly protected. However, she noticed that, as their group slowly shrank, they were not going towards the direction of the wall; it was at that moment that a worried Lisa lashed out at him, causing Tony to explain he was <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyInItForTheMoney" target="_blank">only in it for the money</a> and that they were headed to the Simpsons residence, like it or not. Threatened with a gun to her head, she acquiesced; by the time she got there, all they could hear was Jefford’s voice in the megaphones spread accross the neighborhoods.</p>

    <p>Someone who could also hear Jeff’s messages was Claire. She was with her dad, Math Kell, and her boyfriend Milhouse, stuck inside and trying their best to not listen to Jeff’s messages. Although Claire was all in on Lisa’s plans, she was worried that she and her family would suffer because of it. After more minutes of this, however, Jeff’s message was abruptly cut short and replaced with a different message, from someone completely different: Lexanna.</p>

    <blockquote>A deafening hiss replaced the canned speech. Milhouse, Math, and Claire shrank back, hands clamped over their ears. The relief of that hellish noise ending would’ve been enough on its own, but it was quickly overtaken by a deeper, sharper satisfaction when a new voice broke through. It wasn’t Lisa, but there was no doubt she’d had a hand in it.<br/><br/>“Well… hello?” It was a young woman’s voice, slightly husky. “I’m usually fine speaking in public, but I’ve never done it for this many people before. And I’ve definitely never risked being gunned down for it. My name’s Lexanna, though I doubt any of you have the faintest idea who I am. I won’t drag this out longer than necessary — I just wanted to let you know that, thanks to some outside help, all military surveillance equipment and systems have been shut down. A rescue operation is already underway, led by a small team of young people. We’re asking you to join the uprising and, if you can, fight alongside us. Fat Tony’s mafia will be your escort, people of Springfield. Please — don’t lose hope.”<br/><br/><div style="text-align: right">from Chapter 206, “<a href="https://www.spiritfanfiction.com/historia/nao-mais-simpsons-14312693/capitulos/22076912" target="_blank">Inoperative Systems</a>”</div></blockquote>

    <p>On the other side of town, Hugo was in jail. He ranted against one of the officers, who was Chinese (even calling him “<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/xing_ling" target="_blank">xing ling</a>”, the Brazilian equivalent of <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ching_chong" target="_blank">ching chong</a>), but the officer was not intimidated by Hugo, saying that Hugo could call him a "weasel face" all he wanted, but <i>he</i> was the actual weasel face there for doubling down on his prejudices. Eventually, he left the room, but at that time, little did he know that that Hugo actually stole the set of keys he was carrying in his belt, and set himself free. At the entrance, while doing his best to not look at the people who stared at him, he noticed a dead soldier: Fernando, who was the one shot by Clancy earlier. He lamented his death; he found him to be one of Jeff’s most competent soldiers, noting it could’ve been anyone else, such as soldiers Troy Seller, Nico Mariano, Gilberti Gagli (none of which make an appearance in this story), the soldier who was watching him, or "a woman." After attempting to retrieve a rifle from a cabinet on that same room, he rapidly noticed that someone thew something at him. A table. The worst of all is that he knew who threw this table at him; it was one of his victims, and also that, once they striked back, he knew only one of them would come alive out of it.</p>

    <p>It was Carl.</p>
    <figure class="center-block">

      <figcaption>Lenny’s there too.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <div class="pull-quote">[…] All that remained was pity, pity for a man whose mind was so closed that he forced his own prejudices to become, in a way, reality.</div>
    <p>The thing is that neither Carl or Lenny expected to see someone dangerous <i>inside</i> the police station, given the remaining officers had all been laid off and the soldiers were roaming the streets. But they were wrong. After throwing the table at Hugo, who slowly got up, he wondered if he could just grab two <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/shotgun">shotguns</a> and run away; that would be unpractical as Hugo would hunt them down. He saw Hugo’s eyes and vaguely remembered seeing those eyes before — in a racoon, that is, that would hunt for food and that Carl helped his dad (presumably <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Carl_Carlson,_Sr.">Carl Carlson, Sr.</a>) caught when they were younger. And Hugo, when he finally got up, said someone like him would not take him down so easily. Both aimed for the weapons cabinet, but neither of them actually went there. Instead they clashed violently, and a lucky Carl slammed Hugo’s head against the floor; his strength failed him and Hugo’s is arms fell limp at his sides. This made Carl ransack th cabinet as quickly as his injuries would allow, and then leave.</p>

    <p>Not too far from there, Homer was with Abe, his father. They were not in Homer’s apartment, but in <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Abe%27s_and_Selma%27s_House" target="_blank">Abe’s old house</a>. Homer was worried about his children, and about the soldier that were gonna reach his house. Or well, what once was his house, he corrected himself. Seeing his current state, Abe went to a nearby room and grabbed two really shotguns, alongside their ammunition. Telling Homer to not doubt him when he talked about his war days, the two of them went outside and, after a lot of shouting and gunpowder, they fought — and somehow survived.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile, Bart tried his best to get Pearl and Zero packed into their pet houses — Pearl went in nicely, but Zero stayed under their bed —, but was interrupted by a sound downstairs. At the front door, he was horrified: Marge was holding her own bag against the wall, Lisa was there with a gun, and Fat Tony was there, holding Collin by his arms. It was at that point where Zero ran down the stairs and attacked Tony, biting him and having Collin hold him back. Tony demanded Lisa to give him the rest of the money she’d promised, but Lisa explained she spent the rest of her money making sure every citizen of Springfield would start their lives anew elsewhere — including their costs of travel, ways to bribe authorities, <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/counterfeit">counterfeit</a> passports. Tony didn’t believe her; she had inherited so much money from Burns that this would be nothing compared to her total wealth.</p>

    <p>A technical Lisa tried to explain that she received only part of his fortune (purposely ommiting the fact it was about 80% of it), saying she’d donated 90% of what she got to <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/charity">charity</a>, and noting she’d spent the rest on making sure Springfield was self-sustainable during the siege. Finding out Lisa to be a scam, and not a genius as rumors said, and cancelled the deal they had. They’d be alive, at least, but now they’d have no escape route. It was at that time when, unexpectedly, Homer showed up. Wielding his shotgun, he threatened Fat Tony to do what he’d promised them to; he overheard the entire conversation and, unbeknownst to Tony, had killed his own right-hand man (who was outside the Simpsons’ house). With Lisa aiming her own gun at Tony and Collin retrieving Tony’s handgun, Bart began to realize that, perhaps, Lisa was <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainsAndBrawn" target="_blank">smarter than he thought</a>.</p>

    <div class="pull-quote">— […] Instead of protecting my daughter from all this crap, I did the opposite. I was the one who demanded the most from her […] who pressured her, terrified her. I’d been so deeply scarred by everything I’d gone through at the hands of others that, without even realizing it, I made her go through the very same things. And it was even worse. Worse because I was her mother — I was supposed to protect her. But in the end, what I did was tear her apart, break her mind […] what I did was kill her.</div>
    <p>The next scene involves the Flanders: Lenna, seeing the violence outside, was begging Ned for them to leave before they’d all get killed. Ned, however, insisted that they should be patient, given that God would protect him. She was upset; even in times like this, Ned would insist in being a religious fanatic. But Ned told her that she had no right over his children; and that while he ignored the <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/therapy" target="_blank">therapy</a> sessions Todd went to, he would not stay with her if she kept interferring with them. Lenna, wishing that she’d done these things to her daughter Cristianne much earlier, told him that he could not understand everything she went through in life. It was at that point where they looked at Todd, who said he’d go with Lenna — and Rod, who was still in the city. After begging Ned one more time, he told her that she could protect him in a way no one could, but that he could not leave, as God would protect him. The two of them left without looking back; maybe this would be the last time they’d see each other.</p>

    <p>Finally, the next scene takes us to the Indelinquents; Dolph looked out at the window as a melancholic Nelson drank beer. Sherri and Terri, alongside Jimbo, were also there. (Kearney is not shown in the scene) Eventually, Nelson threw the beer bottle at the wall, and announced he was going outside. His goal was simple: he would <a hef="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/distract" target="_blank">distract</a> them so they could have a chance of escaping. But Terri told him this would be unwise; not only he’d die, but he’d also spoil their location to the soldiers. Realizing he needed to act, he asked Dolph, Sherri and Terri to form a barricade, and for Jimbo to have his slingshot ready. And he went outside. He thought of his mom; she left him behind, once again. But he didn’t care about it; it only got worse when he saw Bart’s family and realized how much better they seemed, how much Marge loved him… but he went outside, with a smile on his face, and realized that perhaps, he didn’t need her, because he had a family, his friends. Five minutes later, Nelson was history.</p>

      <figcaption>So long, friend.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>When Lenny saw Carl wounded after the fight with Hugo, Carl just told him they needed to leave. He wouldn’t want to be there when Hugo woke up, and Lenny agreed. As they progressed towards the <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/meeting_point">meeting point</a>, doing their best to ignore the sounds of gunfight and screaming, Lenny told Carl that, honestly, he always wanted to leave Springfield. He didn’t hate the city or its people, but he hated his family: how his <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Lenny_Leonard%27s_father" target="_blank">father</a> and <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Lenny_Leonard%27s_grandmother" target="_blank">grandma</a> used to beat him, how his <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Lenny_Leonard%27s_mother" target="_blank">mother</a> ignored him, or how his cousins ignored him, beat him, or tried to make him into a "real man." But he didn’t want to leave now; his parents were dead, and he’d long left his grandmother’s house after he first admitted to her that he was, in fact, gay. He’d stayed at a friend’s house for a couple of months, and he never heard of his other family members again. Though Carl tried to interject, explaining he wasn’t exactly gay, a soldier caught them and aimed his gun at them. They heard a gunshot.</p>

    <p>The next scene shows Meg and Lexanna, once again alone, and walking through the woods. Though Lexanna didn’t think she was suited and would hurt more than help their plan, Meg insisted she would be safer there. After all, Meg said, she was <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/isolating" target="_blank">isolating</a> herself from everyone. A tearful-eyed Lexanna told Meg that her father was a <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pastor" target="_blank">pastor</a>, her mom was a teacher at a <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Sunday_school" target="_blank">Sunday school</a>, and her grandma was deeply religious. Lexanna said she never ran away, but Meg did — from her, because she was gay. She dealt with these types of people every day at home. And while Meg told Lexanna she could talk this out with her parents, Lexanna insisted she couldn’t; despite being a pacifist, she joined the military school to get away from them. And she thought she had a friend in Meg, who abandoned her just like everyone because of her sexuality. Lexanna went there to get rid of her problems; Meg went there because she didn’t want to deal with the solution to her problems; <a href="https://preview.redd.it/really-we-are-not-the-same-v0-7z7l9yieo1va1.jpg?width=1080&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=9bd9a4dece3018a7edf88702d2d25414e5b01d70" target="_blank">they were not the same</a>.</p>

    <p>She idolized Meg, she saw Meg as the only person who could care about her… until she didn’t. Perhaps Lexanna was broken, perhaps she was the problem here. Meg desperately explained she just didn’t know what to do or how to react to it. Lexanna told her that she was lesbian before she found out and still was, and just wanted her <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/friendship" target="_blank">friendship</a> back. And Meg said yes.</p>

    <p>The next chapter takes us to Abe. He didn’t go along with Homer; he instead went to the <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Springfield_Retirement_Castle" target="_blank">Springfield Retirement Castle</a>, the city’s home for the elderly, and began recalling of his stories in life. His time in Vietnam; when he deserted the Army and lived off as a woman in disguise; when he came back home and, after facing sanctions for it, met Mona, the love of his life… he tried to remember everything, although the fact he was an alcoholic in the past made some portions of his life a mystery to him. He only stopped drinking after Meg was born, and he started recalling how he wished Homer would be better than him, or his father, but instead turned out to be a mirrored version of his own father; and eventually, he tried living his life away from his son. When he entered the castle, he noticed all his old friends were still there, sitting, looking at him. They all realized they couldn’t escape from there, and so, deciding that since they were going to stay, perhaps they could do one last thing: find a nearby gas station, and light the whole place up.</p>

    <p>Not too far from there, Moe knew what was going to happen; he heard things from Fat Tony associates, and also other people in town, that something was brewing. When the plan happened, he was quite prepared for it; he wielded his shotgun and, despite barely using it, he realized he still had the hang of it. He was hidden in <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Moe’s_Tavern" target="_blank">his bar</a>, knowing that it would be insane to join the people outside, instead opting to shoot whoever he saw from the windows. One of them was a soldier that was tall, white, and was frequently behind places that’d be hard to shoot, like cars or trees. When he noticed this soldier eventually caught Lenny and Carl, he didn’t think twice before shooting, killing him instantly. When he came to meet the two, they asked him to come with them, but Moe insisted he would stay. He told them that he was only alive for two reasons: Meg, and his bar. After listening to Tony’s drunken employees, he realized that Lisa and the mafia wouldn’t just be taking them out of Springfield; they’d get their own passports and would have to fend for themselves on the other side of the world. Though he imagined that, thanks to her money, she would be able to get both legally married, this also meant Moe would likely never see Meg again, regardless if he stayed or left. And if he stayed, after all of this was over, at least he’d have this bar to help others drown their sorrows. Finally, he asked them to do a favor for him.</p>

    <p>The next chapter shows the POV of Springfield: a lot of stuff had gone down, and the city was in total chaos. A Jefford subordinate named Fineas (probably a mispelling of <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Finneas" target="_blank">Finneas</a> was at the city hall-turned-HQ when one of his officials came to him, warning him about something. As the fire alarms sounded, they rapidly realized a lot of elderly people were burning the entire city down. Although they were able to rapidly retrieve them, by that point it was too late; the city hall was a victim of one of these fires and collapsed. Not too far from there, in the police headquarters, a very weak Hugo began to wake up. And also not too far from there, Jefford marched in the direction of everyone else, all the citizens running from the city. When these people reached an area in the outskirts of the city, where the houses were all but bare, they found a large <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sewage" target="_blank">sewage</a> tunnel that was not only fake, but was their exit. Except that Jeff was there.</p>

    <figure class="center-block">
      <img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/G_xt44hWEAE2CEU?format=jpg&name=large" alt="Homer dancing with a fire behind him" class="img-responsive center-block" />
      <figcaption>The city fire was a lot like this, believe it or not.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>Jeff hated the mafia. His bosses had threatened to replace him if he didn’t stop their plans, and he’d been trying to catch them for months. When he saw them, he was surprised, however, when he saw Fat Tony being held "<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hostage" target="_blank">hostage</a>"   by the citizens, and their leader, a small girl: Lisa, albeit Jeff didn’t know her. Jeff told her that they were not allowed to leave the town, and when asked why, he stumbled and said it was due to the "contamination". But the much smarter Lisa knew this was not true; right after Mr. Burns death, the nuclear plant was transferred to Mr. Smithers, who had done enough to make sure everything was running smoothly, even with the recent cuts. (Lisa does not mention Sideshow Bob’s invasion to the plant, which she did not know of. Although Jeff could have also mentioned how they were "gearing up" to prevent a possible contamination, which they did very shortly after Sideshow Bob’s plans <i>and</i> in light of Burns’ death, this is not mentioned by him.) There would be no need for such a long quarantine period; all of this was done for the sake of power, of status… if this story leaked, the United States’s worldwide reputation would suffer, especially with regards to their human rights policies. Jefford rapidly realized he could not argue with her.</p>

    <p>She told Jeff he really had no choice; them staying in Springfield was not an option. A couple of them aimed their guns at him. A gunshot was heard, but it came from neither Jeff’s side nor Lisa’s side; a 23-year-old guy fell and, when Jeff looked to his right, he saw the man himself: Hugo. He looked terrible, and his twisted smile showed he was out of his mind. He fired another shot, hitting Fat Tony in the head and killing him instantly; this bullet also hit the person who was holding him, Homer, causing Lisa to go in his direction to make sure he was okay. Hugo tried aiming again. That girl was just in the right spot… but before he could do anything, Jeff shot him. Hugo was dead.</p>

    <blockquote>Jeff gasped for air. His arms burned with the searing pain from the recoil of the machine gun.<br/><br/>Yeah. He was definitely getting discharged from the army.<br/><br/>Fuck this.<br/><br/>“You there — get moving before I change my mind,” he barked at the crowd.<br/><br/>The girl nodded, her eyes a mix of seriousness and gratitude, and began rallying the people to cross quickly and in order.<br/><br/>Jeffrey just hoped it hadn’t all been for nothing.<br/><br/><div style="text-align: right">from Chapter 218, “<a href="https://www.spiritfanfiction.com/historia/nao-mais-simpsons-14312693/capitulos/24537638" target="_blank">Machine Gun Threat</a>”</div></blockquote>

    <hr/>

    <p>The story ends here. Brendon’s final chapter of No More Simpsons was posted on January 2023; he passed away five months later. For this reason, this story was never finished. It may be very possible that he wrote the ending to the story somewhere — this story was made in 2018, and he noted even back then that he already planned everything out in advance. Either way, the details he left us do give us an idea of where the story would’ve headed to next, with Lisa, her family, and a good chunk of Springfield escaping — and also with a bunch of characters likely dying. This is just a guess, but I believe Ned, Rod (who just vanishes in the latter half Act 3), Abe, possibly Moe, possibly the Indelinquents… too many to count. The story’s actual chapter count probably varied a bit as Brendon wrote it, but one thing he was quite sure of: this story would end at 221 chapters. After some thinking, I decided to give it a shot and write a version of how the endings of this story would have be, around late December 2023-early January 2024.</p>

    <p>Obviously, I don’t think this is perfect. In fact, I think I was too lenient on some of the characters here; Brendon would’ve definitely killed more characters than I did here (only one, technically), though I tried my best to make sure this wasn’t a "happy ending for everyone" because, even if they were alive, they’d still be suffering, given everything that happened and how many of their friends perished. Still, I tried my best to tie all lose ends; because of the way I wrote this, this came off as really long in comparison to the story; my initial version of this was almost 10k words long. For comparison, the average chapter in this story has ~417 characters; this story would be the length of about 25 NMS chapters, or longer than 2/5 of Act 1!</p>

    <p>Even then, I made some mistakes, which I realized over the course of writing this analysis. There is a good reason for this: when reading this story, I wrote mini-summaries using text-to-speech (TTS) so I could read them back eventually, especially to write the last three chapters of the story. However, after reading chapter 182, I more or less skimmed through the remaining 36 chapters for the sake of reading them all, and also so I could get to writing the first chapter of the "final three". This was good in that it helped me recall some details I missed, but bad in that I missed out on a lot of smaller details in the latter half of Act 3, which I think negatively affected part of that story. Not only I missed some details that Brendon himself sort of left along the way (e.g. Keusley as Kearney’s son, Cristianne’s relations with her mother, etc.), but I made some errors of my own: for example, I made up an event that was caused by Frink Jr. and Grandson, mostly because it was not listed in the story what Grandson did after Lexanna’s phone call to him. But then I realized something, over a year and a half later, about this. Remeber when Lexanna hijacked the speakers? See, it wasn’t her who did it: it was Grandson! That was an error on my part. And in other cases, I accidentally made it seem like some characters knew of events that happened while they weren’t there; an example is that I wrote how Lisa knew about Sideshow Bob’s new and improved superhuman status, although she couldn’t have known that he pressed a button and caused all of this, not unless someone told her.</p>

    <p>But perhaps the worst mistake I did here was with Rod and Rodric. In the original story, Rodric escapes the makeshift camp he shared with Ann Brie, Lexanna, and Meg, only to be caught by soldiers and taken into custody, where he reveals their plan to Jeff. The thing is, I actually thought it was Rod (Flanders’ son) and *not* Rodric who did this, and so I wrongly assumed that Rod was kept locked up instead. Not only that, but Rodric was not locked up as in "jailed", as I assumed; although he was interrogated by Jeff, he was still one of Jeff’s soldiers, and although it’s hard to know exactly what would happen, given that neither make any appearances in the story after this, it is reasonable to assume he just joined Jeff’s force again, given that Hugo wasn’t around to berate him.</p>

    <p>Either way, this was quite fun to write, and I hope you enjoy anyway. I might stop by here from time to time to correct the details I got wrong, which I might have.</p>

    <h1 id="justanothersimpson">Just Another Simpson</h1>
    <h2 id="c1">Chapter 1</h2>

    <p>It hadn’t been an easy journey to get there.</p>

    <p>For a long time, Lisa thought her biggest problem was with her family. Homer and Marge hadn’t been getting along for ages, fighting and arguing at practically every moment. She watched their marriage crumble day by day — and when she suggested to her mother that she should get a divorce, she couldn’t say that, in her anguish, her heart didn’t tighten. And Lisa was wrong, because what happened afterward was just as bad. Part of her could never forget what happened with Cristianne. Her best friend for years, since that day they met at the library some 8 years ago, the two of them practically inseparable… was, apparently, only interested in her brother. That obsessive, sick interest that somehow made her take photos of Bart on a beach trip they took, and create a montage where they were together in bed, in sensual poses. She never knew if she leaked the photo on purpose or not, but the damage was done: Claire, Bart’s girlfriend for years, broke up with him, and the leaked image spread through town like a steam engine. Her big brother’s reputation was never the same.</p>

    <p>Learning that it was her friend who created (and maybe leaked) the images was a blow to Lisa. They knew each other so well and, at the same time, knew so little about each other. They were distant, even while so close. When she had the idea to expose her, she didn’t think much about the consequences — even in a plan as elaborate as that one. Getting Meg to break into her house and insert a flash drive that, thanks to work by Milhouse and his friend, a hacker named Bill, would grab the photos from her laptop, making her expose them at Manjula’s kids’ birthday party? Surreal, she thought. But it would just be a harmless prank — despite being furious, she didn’t wish her ill, just wanted her to pay for the crime she’d committed. And when she learned the morning after the party that she had killed herself the night before, that she was no longer in this world, it was clear. She had killed her friend, even if indirectly. If she had kept quiet, if she had tried a one-on-one conversation with her, if she’d been less analytical and more courageous… maybe Cristianne would be there with her, helping her flee the city. Maybe Bart and Cristianne would make a good couple, as weird as it sounded, Claire could move on. But if it weren’t her dying, it would probably be Milhouse next; he was already psychologically stressed, and his problems were nearly exacerbated by Cristianne’s death.</p>

    <p>Not to mention the whole situation with Terwilliger, a.k.a. Sideshow Bob: he didn’t kill Bart, but he got what he wanted, plunging the city into flames and complete chaos. "What was his plan again?" she wondered. Drugging her father was already absurd, and having the Indelinquents invade her house too, but it was something she struggled to understand… why Bart? What exactly did he do to Bob? He knew that Bob had been hunting him down for ages already, but she couldn’t undestand exactly what led to <i>this</i>, of all things. Why did he go through all of that just to kill him? And when the pieces of this puzzle started fitting together in her head… the accident at the plant occurred. From what she heard, Bob pressed a simple button and caused that whole situation. It was insane; how could Smithers let such a thing happen? Bob, who had already become a superhuman being, with superhuman actions and attitudes, had stopped being human a long time ago. But this was long before that day, or Frink Jr.’s experiments on him. In an alternate reality, he would have been Lisa’s ally to stop Jefford and his army. But that would remain only in her imagination…</p>

    <p>Her world had been upside down for a long time. Maybe even before Cristianne died, before Terwilliger nearly destroyed Springfield, before any of this happened — maybe it started when her parents began fighting, when Bart started hanging out with a different crowd, when Meg left. Hard to say, when under normal circumstances, she could have answered in under a minute. A lot was going on right now. Lisa knew a lot, but at the same time, nothing at all. And knowing everything, for her, meant losing everything… and she’d lost plenty before she ever began to understand.</p>

    <p>For a long time, Bart thought his biggest problem was his love life. Claire was wonderful — graceful, sweet — but what did he really want from her? They’d been together for years, since that incident when he tried to join the Indelinquents and she gave him a moral lesson instead. She was perfect, but he wasn’t perfect for her; their relationship had been built on touch and sensation, not affection. It took him a long time to realize that, and only after she left him over Cristianne’s fake photo scandal. At that party, he’d thought she might take him back, that they’d be happy forever. Wrong.</p>

    <p>She didn’t come back. Over time, he tried to use the breakup to become a better person — to start a redemption arc, a “new saga” in Bart Simpson’s life. He even got closer to Claire again, thinking they might one day have a strong friendship, maybe something more. Wrong again. Milhouse, his best friend for decades, beat him to it and started dating her. Bart didn’t feel jealous, betrayed, or disappointed in them — at least not as much as he thought he would —, but he did feel something rare from their relationship: longing. Longing for the touch, the make-outs (that the whole town pretended not to notice), the little details only they understood. Maybe that was all he’d ever really seen in her — not Claire the person, but “the feeling of Claire,” a metaphysical object, not the woman herself.</p>

    <p>Watching Claire and Milhouse together made him sad — not because they had Claire the person, but because they had something he’d never had: a true love. The kind of thing he always wanted, maybe the kind she wanted too, but that they’d never managed to have together. For him, Claire had been a status object, a badge to climb the school’s and the town’s social ladder. It hadn’t worked, and one night he tried to drown his heartache at a party with the Indelinquents. He never imagined he’d bond with them more than he expected… Nelson, Dolph, Jimbo, Kearney, Sherri, Terri — each with their own problems, their own messes. It seemed like a good idea to stick with them. Until the day he paid the price. Sherri was pregnant. He was the father — and she was going to have an abortion. There was no redemption arc. Now his friends were hiding somewhere, and he wasn’t there to help them. Maybe, above all, he’d always be irresponsible. And it was strange to admit that now, with a civil war raging in town… but maybe, in its own way, it was for the best.</p>

    <p>For a long time, Meg thought her biggest problem was her family. Her parents fought constantly, and she couldn’t stand them anymore. Marge was a poor, easily irritated woman who couldn’t hold her own in an argument, and her father was just another drunk who barely knew what he was doing and spent more time out of the house than in. Her sister, smart as she was, was boring and sloppy, doing things haphazardly and hoping for the best, while her brother — for all his devilishness — was just childish. So when she had the chance to attend military school, she didn’t hesitate. She asked Moe — her second father ever since he saved her life eight years ago — if he’d be okay with it; when he said yes, she left without saying goodbye to most of the family. The experience wasn’t perfect, but it wasn’t bad either — though she later wondered if it had been worth it. Gerald Samson, her longtime rival, was there too, but she didn’t pay him much attention. She was busy — not just with classes, but with a new friend named Lexanna. Lexanna seemed perfect, with the highest IQ in the school and an effortless way of handling things, even for Meg. That perfection, that almost goddess-like image, that near-admiration Meg had for her, shattered when Samson told her Lexanna was a lesbian.</p>

    <p>It was terrible! What was she supposed to do? Surely Lexanna would want to be with her someday, right? But Meg didn’t feel the same. That feeling — part prejudice, part uncertainty — ate at her for months. A lot had happened since that revelation: Gerald was found dead in a forest near the camp; someone was apparently trying to kill her family; and after Springfield was sealed off by a massive wall, the military school’s headmaster Boll claimed she was his “defensive weapon” against the city — which left her confused. Meg had never guessed how much life had beaten down Lexanna. She didn’t know Rod and Laura — strange as their relationship was — had problems she couldn’t fathom. She didn’t know that Rodric and Ann Brie, the “test subject” soldiers she and Lexanna had captured for a plan, were basically outcasts among their own friends at the camp. And Meg herself, with the chance to face her own problems, had almost thrown it away, nearly walked off forever. She was growing up.</p>

    <p>For a long time, Homer and Marge thought their biggest problems were, besides themselves, their spouses. Marge had every reason to complain about Homer: he did nothing, didn’t stay home, wasn’t responsible with the salary he received, and fortunately never knew about Lisa’s wealth — otherwise, they would have fallen into poverty much earlier, and none of them in the city would be alive now. It was very difficult for her to make the decision she made. She saw her husband, whom she thought was a careless man, cheat on and beat her (she would later learn he had been drugged by Sideshow Bob), and understood there was no way forward. Asking for divorce wasn’t easy, because despite the process being lengthy, a part of her still loved him. Maybe for his playful ways, maybe for his goofy mannerisms, maybe precisely for being Homer. And Homer could say the same about Marge, because despite not agreeing with everything she did, and admitting he himself was irresponsible, he continued loving her. After so many drinks at Moe’s, so many moments in that poor apartment with his father, Abraham, so many dreams… his mistake was not realizing sooner that he was making the same mistakes his father made, and wanted his son not to make.</p>

    <p>Each of the people crossing that tunnel had their problems. Lenna, for example, had pain and grief in her heart for letting her daughter — Cristianne — die. For not being so helpful, for having put her under a lot of pressure, for maybe not having been a good mother. Todd, Ned Flanders’ son who was under her care, had pain and grief for another person: Ralph, his friend who, despite finding a bit strange, didn’t deserve the death he got, buried by meters and meters of toxic nuclear waste, released by that disgusting plant. He loved him, even with the doubt of what the word love meant in this case. And Lenna would always continue loving her daughter. Claire and Milhouse, despite everything in their relationship, felt fear. Fear for their friends, fear that something would happen to them, fear they wouldn’t be able to move forward, but also confidence in themselves. Carl and Lenny felt the same way, along with uncertainty about whether they could finally live in peace, besides hesitating about leaving the city where they were born, lived. Springfield didn’t deserve that end.</p>

    <p>For Laura, some people shouldn’t have had that end. Rod, for example, despite being a complete perverted alien, didn’t deserve to die there — and she hoped he was okay. Her son, little Andrew, whom she hoped was safe in his mother’s hands, didn’t deserve to die. For Lisa, Fat Tony, despite his antagonistic ways, shouldn’t have died. At least not at that complicated moment — she knew well that, if it wasn’t for him, no one would have escaped from there. Despite the idea being hers, the execution of the plan was his: providing fake passports for the citizens, who, after escaping the city, would spread throughout the countries of the world. It was an ambitious idea, maybe bold, but surprisingly effective. She just didn’t want things to have reached that point.</p>

    <p>Jeffrey, the director of that squadron, followed behind the group of inhabitants in the tunnel, providing cover. He had seen so much suffering, so much confusion, so much madness… a few minutes ago, he had killed Hugo, his childhood friend. It wasn’t an easy choice — not that he had been making many easy choices along the way — but that was one that, despite everything, he thought was necessary. It was either that or he would be killed instead, to be fair. Springfield wasn’t perfect, but he came to nurture a special affection for the city, for its inhabitants, for those who lived there, grew up there. It wasn’t easy having to almost destroy it to move forward. He hoped far fewer people would die — but his heart prevailed. As he passed through the tunnel and left the city, breathing that fresh air, not very polluted, the group was received by several helicopters. The vast majority were from the Army, but some appeared to be from both local and international television channels. In other words, the press. It was something Jeff didn’t want, at all, to happen, but it happened. My God.The whole world would now know what they tried to cover up in there: that they tried to destroy Springfield, tore the city from the Earth, and tried to cover that hole with dirt.</p>

    <p>"Soldiers… lower your weapons and leave them on the ground."</p>

    <p>Upon landing, some helicopters with supplies ran to the numerous wounded, tired citizens, who were only not in worse conditions thanks to the fortune Lisa obtained in Mr. Burns’ will. From other choppers, this time Army choppers, armed guards came out, wanting Jeff to go with them. It would happen sometime, he thought. Even following orders, the noise he caused was too loud.</p>

    <p>And not far from there, a few minutes later, the Simpson family, for the first time in a while showing a kind of smile, gave each other a hug. Marge, Lisa and Bart reunited with their youngest daughter Meg, after almost two years without seeing her.</p>

    <p>"Meg!" Marge shouted. "I don’t know how you’re here, but… thank goodness you’re here."</p>

    <p>"Me too, mom…"</p>

    <p>The family quieted down, maintaining the hug for a few more minutes. Not far from there, Homer — already with both arms and hands bandaged, also ran to the family. Meg gave him another hug, this time longer, and he soon looked at Marge. She smiled.</p>

    <p>"Homer… look, thank you for saving us that time in there, with Tony and everything."</p>

    <p>"I did what I had to do, Marge," he said, looking at his fingers. "I wasn’t going to let anyone hurt my wife- I mean, e-ex-wife. Or my family."</p>

    <p>Bart and Lisa, both emotional about the situation, hugged Homer.</p>

    <p>"Oh, children… you’re not even children anymore, but you’re kinda making my arm hurt even more…"</p>

    <p>On that day, several of Springfield’s citizens, in various physical states — some badly hurt, others in shock, had to be taken to hospitals in the state capital, Jefferson City, to be better treated. Still, Lisa’s plan continued at full steam. Several of the citizens, carrying very few things besides their own documents, passports and the skin on their bodies, went in helicopters, and some in buses and cars, toward the city’s airport, ready to go to their new places, and assume their new lives. No one stopped them; at that point, there was nothing left to stop. The entire country already knew what had happened in Springfield.</p>

    <p>Exhausted, she disembarked from one of the planes, along with her family at the airplane window, which had started to take off. She looked at the world around her. Wow, the world was indeed huge. When the plane passed over a small city, surrounded by a wall, she tried not to look down too much. That place, which had already given her so much happiness, had already brought her so much hatred, had already given her so many moments, now only gave her sadness.</p>

    <hr/>

    <h2 id="c2">Chapter 2</h2>

    <p>The news out of Springfield shocked the world. A nuclear disaster, in the 21st century? Well, it wasn’t exactly unheard of, but in the world’s greatest nation (as they themselves would say)? It was certainly a surprise. And worst of all: it was a nuclear disaster caused by a man with no connection to the plant, who had somehow managed to get inside, sabotage its operations, and push a single button that led to the near-complete destruction of the city.</p>
<p>This news broke through an anonymous tip, published in one of America’s major newspapers. The leak was clear: the U.S. Army, along with the Department of Defense, had taken advantage of the incident to eradicate the city, wipe it off the map, and pretend everything was fine. The supposed “cholera epidemic,” mentioned by some sources, had never occurred; it was a complete fabrication, intended to cover up the incident. And trying to reconcile that story with the nuclear contamination narrative, which other sources had reported, was no easy task for them. Along with this leak, several photos emerged. These photos, taken with a long-distance camera attached to some kind of telescope, showed just how grave the situation in Springfield was.</p>
<p>In short, they depicted moments of human rights violations committed by the military during their occupation of the city. One photo in particular showed a soldier, described by the informant only as “Hugo,” brutally assaulting a teenager who walked past him smoking. Another image showed him entering a local business and leaving a short time later, followed by a photo of the local shopkeeper, covered in scrapes, leaving the establishment. The informant was adamant: the shop owner was beaten because they thought he was an illegal immigrant.</p>
<p>Other images in the same vein showed other soldiers abusing their power, evicting residents, and forcing them to perform degrading activities. Although the photos were low quality (they had a grainy, black-and-white look, and many other photos were taken at night), they were still sharp enough to capture the nuances of the cruelty that had taken place in Springfield.</p>
<p>The press immediately began to work the case. Despite differing opinions within the army, especially regarding how to handle the situation, the head of the Department of Defense had to resign. Even the governor of Missouri had to deal with the fallout — since Springfield was in his state, he had to face the consequences regardless of whether he was aware of the events. But the top of the military and governmental hierarchy wasn’t the only level to be investigated; several soldiers who participated in the Springfield operation were also investigated for possible abuses of power. Boll, who was in charge of the military group that included Meg and Lexanna, was an exception; by stating that he wished no harm on the city, as he was born there, and had worked to restrain the actions of other soldiers, he came out looking like some kind of hero. The situation was more complicated for Jeff, who was accused of abuse of power and homicide. The trial would drag on for some time, but he was beginning to feel certain he had made the right choice.</p>
<p>Not long after a group of citizens escaped — through a fake tunnel near the wall surrounding the city — the state government, this time trying to show that the situation was under control, formed a crisis committee. It dispatched a special team of civilians, trained in nuclear safety, to the city with the goal of answering a few questions by the end of their assessment:</p>
<p>1. What are the environmental conditions (such as air, soil, and especially water quality) in Springfield? Was the city’s decontamination process appropriate? Is there a need to continue, or improve, this process?</p>
<p>2. What is the general condition of the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant and public buildings? What are the general conditions of the neighborhoods? Are there serious infrastructure problems in the affected areas?</p>
<p>3. Is it possible to detail the number of deaths that occurred within the city limits? Of these, how many were from natural causes versus non-natural causes?</p>
<p>The process took about a month, during which the city was, ironically, also "walled off"; no one entered or left without authorization. The head of the report — a Finnish scientist with an unfamiliar name (Alberti Boon, which didn’t even seem like a Finnish name!), — jotted down important descriptions of the city in its new, post-military era.</p>
<blockquote>“[…] the nuclear incident released radioactive material into the soil, material that was being stored behind a type of barrier. Part of this waste was supposed to be treated and the other part stored, but this process had not been carried out for some time, since shortly before the death of the plant’s director, the late Charles Montgomery Burns… with the treatment plant under renovation, security failures at the plant, and a long restructuring process, evidence indicates that a private citizen, name [REDACTED], obtained a piece of experimental, high-tech, long-range equipment, causing the opening of the floodgates…”<br/><br/>
“The air quality in Springfield is within reasonable standards set by the World Health Organization, although the same cannot be said for the quality of the soil, which is extremely vulnerable and susceptible to erosion and other changes in its composition, or the water quality. On a simple scale of 0 to 100, where 0 is most unsuitable or polluted and 100 is least, the water of the river that cuts through the city would receive a 23, and the city lake a staggering 4… although measures were taken by the military to prevent a greater disaster, part of this water remains trapped in the city’s subsoil, and with military control of the local water treatment plant, there was further disorganization regarding the place’s new controllers… […] physical removal of certain contaminants or the alteration of their chemical nature is necessary…” <br/><br/>
“[…] a war zone. There are several destroyed buildings in the city, like the town hall, or with serious structural risks, like the police station. There was a large fire that was brought under control a few days after our arrival. Searching the neighborhoods, we came across the decomposing body of a teenager. He had been shot with a rifle, likely by a soldier. Other such bodies can be found in various states on the city streets. […] we even found a group of people in an abandoned, crumbling house, begging for a scrap of food and water […] a total breakdown of the supply chain.”</blockquote>
<p>Part of the document, however, was kept for confidential use. Especially the sections about the life of Sideshow Bob — the government, of course, didn’t want anyone to know that, at some point, there had been a superhuman being among them. Curiously, no one in that document could pinpoint how he had transformed like that. One witness from the day Bob was arrested at the police station, who hadn’t left the city, swore that the superhuman was indeed him, and investigations at the Springfield plant confirmed a break-in. But how did he become that person — or thing?</p>
<p>Again, nobody knew. Except for a handful of Springfield citizens, now countless countries away… and a certain scientist and his son. It had been about five or six months since the incident. The two had caught a plane in the early hours of the morning and arrived, still in the morning, in the city of Dover, in the southwest of the United Kingdom. Following the directions on the small scientist’s phone map, they arrived at a medium-sized, two-story house in an ordinary suburb. It looked like any other house, but that wasn’t important. He rang the bell on the black gate and waited for someone to answer. When the gate opened and they entered the garden, they stood before the house’s (also black) front door. When the door opened, a girl, perhaps 16 years old, with blonde hair and a distinctive red-orange dress, greeted them.</p>
<p>“F-Frink?”</p>
<p>“—Junior,” the little one pointed to his father. “And I’m Frink Junior Junior, not to be confused with my father Frink Junior or the original Frink, no Junior, who was also a Frink, but not a Junior—”</p>
<p>“I already know you, Frink JJ.”</p>
<p>“Call me Grandson. Everyone does.”</p>
<p>Upon entering the cozy house, Frink Jr. and Grandson got straight to the point. They asked to gather the whole family, as they had something to discuss with them. The family had been living in that place for about five or six months, already with false identities. Lisa was Olivia Moore, Meg was Niki Moore, Marge was Livia Moore, and Bart was Eddie Moore. The IDs produced by Fat Tony were of the highest quality!</p>
<p>The other four soon came to the kitchen table, Bart sleepy and Meg not much in the mood to talk. Zero and Pearl were upstairs, asleep after several minutes of playing. The surprise was when another man came down the stairs, visibly more tired than the others, and sat in one of the chairs. The man, according to his passport, was named Colin Dawson. But anyone who knew him, even at a glance, knew his real name: Homer Simpson.</p>
<p>“Well… I think I have a lot to tell you, and you have a lot to tell me, I believe,” Frink Jr. said, handing Lisa an envelope. As she opened it and read the documents aloud, she quickly realized what it was: the technicians’ report on the state of Springfield. Grandson, observant as always, swore he saw a tear or two escape from Lisa’s eyes. Or maybe it was just a bit of dust in his own?</p>
<p>“I… I can’t believe all of this happened. And it’s all my fault…”</p>
<p>“Why?” Marge tried to calm her daughter. “No one could have predicted what happened—”</p>
<p>“It’s not that, Mom. It’s just… if I hadn’t tried to interfere, m-maybe none of this would have happened and the town would have been f-fine—”</p>
<p>Grandson, who had a much greater familiarity (or <em>rapport,</em> as his mother would say) with Lisa than his father, Frink Junior (not to be confused with the original Frink), smiled.</p>
<p>“Lisa, we’ve been doing some digging. And we found out that this—" he pulled a piece of paper from his pocket, “—Ter… willi… ger… Terwilliger. That guy. He had already put his plan into motion long before you discovered it.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I already knew that. It wasn’t the first time he’d tried something from the top.”</p>
<p>“Actually…” Frink Junior decided to interject, “You only knew part of what he did, in this case. I’ll try to explain as best I can. For who knows how long, the test subject—ahem, Terwilliger, after being arrested so many times and after so many plans went down the drain… an idea lodged itself in his mind that… the boy Bart here was responsible for all of it, all the chaos in his life.”</p>
<p>Everyone present looked at Bart, who grimaced out of the corner of his eye.</p>
<p>“What? I’m not <em>that</em> evil…”</p>
<p>“But he was, though that is hardly news to anyone, not was this the first time he tried to kill you. But for Robert, he had to have his revenge. And the best way to eliminate you was, first, to divert your family’s attention away from you. With… Homer, well, we know he was drugged, which was the final straw in any relationship between him and Mrs. Bouvier, wasn’t it?”</p>
<p>“Y-yes,” Marge agreed, a little hesitantly.</p>
<p>“And that’s not all. Apparently, he got someone to sabotage the military admission exam… to put… Meg’s name, right? And… make her stand out, as if she were a prodigy. From there it was only a matter of time before they contacted her, made the invitation, and sent your daughter to Jefferson City.”</p>
<p>“But wait a minute,” Meg said, surprised, trying to understand. “If they put my name in the running, then how did nobody at the police department know I’d been ‘enlisted’?”</p>
<p>“Because no one told them. They probably received incorrect information, and no one bothered to correct it. It led to what it led to. But there’s more…”</p>
<p>As he was sharing this information, another boy came down the stairs. The boy, the same age as Lisa with brown hair, had the name Wallace on his passport. But like the others, it was a fake name: this was Collin, Lisa’s boyfriend. (Perhaps having two Collins in that household, the real Collin and a fake Collin, was quite confusing.) He stood behind Lisa, a little confused by Frink’s appearance, but said nothing.</p>
<p>“Lisa,” Frink Jr. pointed to the girl. “You know the old Flanders residence? The one that was for sale a few years ago?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“The one who moved into it was the boy… I forgot your name.”</p>
<p>“Collin.”</p>
<p>“Collin! And his father. So far, nothing unusual… except we discovered that he manipulated several conversations so that the news would reach Collin’s father.”</p>
<p>With a hand on her chin, Lisa struggled to grasp the situation.</p>
<p>“But there’s nothing wrong with that, is there? It’s strange, but… why?”</p>
<p>“Let’s just say…” Grandson intervened, “It was on purpose. Again, he wanted you to be distracted, of course, so it would be easier to assassinate Bart. But supposedly he discovered a secret of yours, and that’s why he went ahead with his plan.”</p>
<p>“Something… of mine?” She thought for a moment, and when she realized what he was talking about, she covered her face with her hands. “Oh… do you have anything else to talk about?”</p>
<p>“Sorry. But… actually, we came here to find out if you want to go back to Springfield.”</p>
<p>The shock was universal. It was a simple, innocent question, but it was a stark reminder of how much the family had suffered in recent years. Both mentally (Marge, Lisa, Meg) and physically (Bart) — not to mention people like Homer, who wasn’t quite ex-family yet, Collin, who was a step below, and their pets Pearl and Zero.</p>
<p>Frink Junior, trembling slightly, spoke again.</p>
<p>“I… I’m not going to say the place is beautiful, it’s quite the opposite. But the survivors, and also the committee that was tasked with assessing the city, have tried their best. But you could just visit if you’d prefer—”</p>
<p>He was interrupted by Lisa’s index finger, which stopped inches from his mouth. Her eyes were shining, almost welling up with tears.</p>
<p>“I… was born there. And the place was never great, it was almost always a dump. We’ve suffered so much these last few years. I watched my best friend die and thought it was my fault. I watched Ralph die and thought it was my fault. I’ve seen so many disasters right in front of me… but that’s my home. Springfield is my, it’s <em>our</em> city. And we’re going back.”</p>
<p>No one else said a word. It was almost funny… but it showed exactly how much affection they had for the place. Frink Junior, who was born there, and Grandson, who had lived part of his life there, agreed. Before they could say anything else, another person came down the stairs: a girl, slightly taller than Meg, no more than 11 or 12 years old. Some might call her Monica, but others knew her real name was Lexanna.</p>
<p>“Morning everyone… I didn’t miss anything, did I?”</p>
<p>Grandson, confused by the number of characters entering this scene, questioned:</p>
<p>“Lisa, you didn’t bring the whole city into your house, did you?”</p>
<p>“Well…” Bart chimed in. “She tried, didn’t she? But there was only room for about ten. There were four of us, five with Homer, six with Collin, seven with Lexanna, nine with Zero and Pearl… but we’ve got a spot for you—”</p>
<p>The others began to boo him playfully. To ease the tension, Frink Jr. asked for a glass of water while Lisa considered her next steps. Grandson, who was by her side, also had an idea in his head. One he wouldn’t tell Lisa, but that she might just like.</p>

    <hr/>
    <h2 id="c3">Chapter 3</h2>

    <p>Lisa wasn’t going back to Springfield alone. Even with her family coming along, she knew other people would want to join them. That afternoon, she called several people who had fled Springfield with her family, asking if they wanted to go along with her new plan. There were countless contacts, some closer to her, others farther away. For example, Claire, Milhouse, and her father were in Calais, France — luckily, the ferry service made travel between their cities possible, which made it easier for them to meet up (especially for Bart, since he had always been closer to Milhouse than Lisa was to Claire). Milhouse’s own parents lived in the same city, not far from their son. It was funny to imagine that, despite everything, they somehow stuck together this time.</p>

    <figure class="center-block">
      <img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/G_OmUc3XcAAfQeD?format=jpg&name=large" alt="Homer turning French" class="img-responsive center-block" />
      <figcaption>No story roles, and now relegated to being French?!</figcaption>
    </figure>

<p>But other citizens were farther away. Carl and Lenny, if she wasn’t mistaken, were enjoying a long honeymoon in Malta, the island in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea, living a much less chaotic life compared to their time in the States — especially with their forged documents making it clear they were a married couple. Lenna and Todd, who had also escaped with them (she never found out what happened to Ned or Rod Flanders, though), were living not too far from there, in the Netherlands. Poor Todd had suffered so much… she hoped that, in the last six months, he’d had the chance to learn what he never got to in school. Laura was with her mother (or grandmother?) somewhere in the south of Scotland, Apu was with Manjula and the octuplets in Lisbon, and she could spend a whole afternoon recounting the stories of the other residents… there were so many of them.</p>
<p>In the not-so-distant past, she could have hardly gotten the whole city (or, in this case, part of it) to rally together for anything that wasn’t about money. It was almost funny — they were only alive because Mr. Burns had passed on and left a mountain of endless money to Lisa. But the truth was that many of them shared the same sentiment: the place was a dump, but it was <i>their</i> dump — if anyone was going to clean it up, it would be them. After many days of discussion with the group she’d gathered, she agreed, once again, to pay for everyone’s tickets. Although she still wanted to follow through on her promise to Burns — to spend all his money — she was seriously considering letting at least part of it accrue interest, depending on what state the city was in. That way she could keep something for her family while also keeping true to her word. She was already doing her best to take care of Bobo, Burns’ prized teddy bear, too.</p>
<p>With everything ready, she arrived with her family (plus Collin and Lexanna) at an airport near Jefferson City in the dead of night. Five days had passed since their conversation with Frink Jr. and Grandson, and it had been exactly six months and 12 days since they’d left Springfield. The seven of them piled into a rented (and rather cramped) car, heading down one of the highways that led to the city. Marge held her younger daughter in her lap, while Lexanna sat on Lisa’s. As they approached the city and passed through a checkpoint that had probably been there since the military arrived, they began to take in the startling new reality. The air was much cleaner, since some of the city’s industries had been shut down when the accident at the plant occurred.</p>
<p>But it was a strange feeling. As they looked at the houses on the streets they passed, they saw some destroyed, others vandalized, and even the remnants of homes that had once stood there. It was a post-apocalyptic city, even though a fair number of people still lived there. Marge, who had swapped driving with Homer midway, decided it wasn’t time — not yet, at least — to go downtown. A few soldiers were still spread throughout the neighborhoods, not marching as before, but in a few isolated corners. Meg swore she saw a soldier in a blue helmet, from the United Nations, but could it really be that bad? She wasn’t sure. Since some neighborhoods were still restricted due to the numerous potholes in the asphalt, the car carrying the Simpsons and their companions stopped in a suburb near their old house.</p>
<p>“Alright,” said Marge, getting out of the car, “since we have to stop here, let’s split up and meet who we need to meet. When you’re done, we can meet up at Moe’s bar… or what’s left of it. Frink said it would be okay with the military here.”</p>
<p>Everyone agreed and went their separate ways. Marge decided to go with Homer to find her family; Meg and Lexanna went to see if Laura had arrived in town, or if Rod had come back from the dead (they didn’t know his whereabouts). Bart, Collin, and Lisa continued down the street ahead, since just a few streets and blocks away was a house familiar to them all. It wasn’t their house, but it was a place they needed to check on.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Homer and Marge walked for a few minutes to a part of the neighborhood with a larger number of people — that is, greater than zero. Some time well before the incident, Patty and Selma had moved from their apartment to the <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Bouvier_House" target="_blank">old family home</a>. Ah, that house with the light-purple hue… it was well-preserved, thankfully. After getting out of the car and walking to the front door, she knocked and waited a moment. The door opened, revealing Selma, with her magnificent smoke-colored hair and a cigarette in her mouth, which fell to the floor when she saw Marge.</p>
<p>What followed was an almost comical mix of happiness and emotion. Marge hugged her sister, then ran inside to hug Patty, who had been sitting motionless and in complete silence on her living room armchair for about five minutes. Bored out of her mind, she couldn’t believe what she was seeing. Homer also entered the house, giving lukewarm handshakes and much shorter hugs, when he heard a voice from another room.</p>
<p>“I thought you weren’t gonna remember me anymore…”</p>
<p>And there he was. His father, Abraham, looking exactly the same as when they had last seen each other. Except, of course, for a few injuries and the exaggerated amount of foundation that had been applied to his face. He was alive, somehow. There was no helping it: he ran immediately to his father and wrapped him in a hug that knocked them both to the floor. In response, Homer got a whack on the head with Abe’s cane.</p>
<p>“If you knew how to shoot better, we would’ve solved this problem much sooner! I can’t stand watching these… what do you call ’em? These ’entertainment’ shows!” he said, making air quotes with his fingers. “In my day, we did it better and with much less money!”</p>
<p>Marge had to explain what had happened to them, wanting to know if everyone was okay (or at least in decent shape). Homer, trying to recover from the lump forming on his head, went to the kitchen freezer to get some ice to soothe it.</p>
<hr/>
<p>It was curious, but Meg and Lexanna didn’t have a general sense of where they could go. Lexanna had a reasonable knowledge of Springfield, but she was just following Meg. Meg, for her part, did have someone she could meet, but since they were all heading to Moe’s later, she could wait a little. Her friend, who had been quiet for most of the trip, began to speak perhaps her first words of the day.</p>
<p>“We never really talked about that, did we?”</p>
<p>“You’re right, we didn’t,” Meg said, focusing more on the houses and the worn asphalt than on Lexanna. “Or well, not as much. I’m not good with words… but I have to thank you. If it weren’t for you, we wouldn’t be walking here today. I… I should have been less selfish with you.”</p>
<p>She smiled. “That’s all I wanted to know. Seriously, Meg, you’re one of the best people I’ve met in all my years of existence. Don’t ever change.”</p>
<p>As they walked down the deserted street, Meg eventually noticed a small dot on the horizon (or, in this case, the end of the street). Maybe two dots. Wait: there were four dots! Four people. Soldiers? They could be, but they didn’t seem to be in uniform. At least, not some of the dots, she thought. As she got closer, she realized that yes, there were soldiers. Two of them, in fact, and also two people who didn’t look like soldiers (how many times had she thought that word?). In front were Ann Brie and Rodric — better known as the two soldiers she and Lexanna had to kidnap (politely, of course) to put their plan to infiltrate the city into action — and behind them, Laura and Rod, whom they knew a little better. (The two of them tried their best to not recall that, technically, Lisa’s plans of escaping almost failed because of Rodric leaking them.) And to top it off, the four of them looked a bit alike…</p>
<p>She hadn’t imagined their reunion would be in the middle of a random street in a random neighborhood, but it would do. Lexanna, who had been smiling ever since her conversation with Meg ended, smiled even wider. Could she have known they would be passing by? Honestly, Meg didn’t even want to know. She just quickened her pace into a run and hugged the first person she saw. The hug, which soon became a group hug, didn’t knock anyone to the ground this time.</p>
<p>“W-where have you two been?” asked Rod, who was wearing a light gray sweatshirt. “I almost died here, you know? They left me locked up in the police station. Lucky I escaped, otherwise I would have burned to death…”</p>
<p>“You have no idea how hard it was to find this boy,” replied Laura, who had apparently arrived in Springfield before the family. “And I took the opportunity to invite our new friends, Ann and Rod 2, so we could have our reunion…”</p>
<p>Fortunately, everyone seemed to be in good shape, and even Lexanna, who had always thought she had few friends in life, looked at the sextet and thought: maybe she wasn’t so alone in the world after all. They would spend the next few minutes talking about the city, and about some other events, but they still had a lot to catch up on.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Walking through the deserted streets in a neighborhood of the city, Lisa, Collin, and Bart didn’t say much. It was strange to be there after being away for so long. She had thought about leaving the city a few times, but she never thought she would be gone for so long, or that she would return to find the city in such a state. It was a miracle Springfield was still standing; the fires set in the city had caused a good deal of destruction, from what little she had seen.</p>
<p>But at some point, they would have to talk, especially with Bart knowing exactly where they were going.</p>
<p>“Bart, I—” Collin tried to find the words. “D-do we really have to go there? We don’t even know if they’re really there—”</p>
<p>“Dude,” he interrupted her. “They’re there. I’m sure of it. And if they’re not, well, there are plenty of other places for us to look. This is the first stop.”</p>
<p>Lisa couldn’t hide the worry on her face. “So Bart, that’s the problem. Remember when I got passports for everyone, that whole story with Fat Tony and all?”</p>
<p>“I remember.”</p>
<p>“Yeah… well, I kind of didn’t pay for that many people. I didn’t know everyone’s whereabouts, so… the Indelinquents kind of got left out. And I know *nothing* about what happened to them — Kearney, Nelson, Jimbo… I don’t know.”</p>
<p>“Relax, we’re almost there. We’ll get there, we’ll see them, and everything will be okay. Alright? Don’t worry.”</p>
<p>She sighed, and silence reigned once more. A short walk later, they arrived at their destination: an abandoned house, as decrepit as the last time they’d seen it, more than a year ago (for Lisa, at least). Still, it was a little different, with several barricades here and there and even a barbed-wire fence covering part of the front yard. Not that the situation in Springfield was the best, but did they really need all that?</p>
<p>“Lisa, are you sure you didn’t tell anyone?” Collin asked, quite anxiously.</p>
<p>“I told Kearney. He was the one who took me to Fat Tony, but I don’t think he heard about the passport story. And he didn’t tell anyone about our meeting either, so that’s the problem.”</p>
<p>The three of them crossed through the wire in the small yard and went to the front door, where Lisa gave three small knocks. Knock-knock-knock. A man answered, a little taller than Collin, wearing a green jacket, a worn-out black shirt, even more worn-out jeans, and a pair of black boots — not to mention a characteristic beanie that had once been red (or purple?). It was Jimbo, whose eyes widened in a way she had never seen before.</p>
<p>“L-L-Lisa?”</p>
<p>“Can we come in, Jimbo?”</p>
<p>“Sure. Uh…”</p>
<p>The three of them entered the house that, honestly, had seen better days. Bart could clearly see the difference. It was much more fortified, but also much more run-down; the paint on the walls had peeled off years ago. The floor was covered with bottles, boxes, and general filth. There was a tube television in the corner, which for some reason was working, even though she thought it was unlikely to have electricity in that house. There was also a small green sofa, where a man with long brown hair, a green shirt, and black shorts was lying down — Dolph.</p>
<p>Perhaps tired, he almost didn’t notice Lisa and Collin’s presence, but he nearly fell over backward when he saw Bart. Staggering a little, he went to the entrance to give a hug to Bart, who was practically a VIP member of the Indelinquents. Bart, embarrassed, didn’t prolong the hug. Dolph soon went to call the other members of the group to the living room, all of them very surprised. Kearney, plus the sisters Sherri and Terri (despite everything, Lisa still couldn’t easily tell who was who). Only one person was missing…</p>
<p>“Where’s Nelson?”</p>
<p>Everyone fell silent. Lisa, finding it strange, tried to change the subject.</p>
<p>“He’s not here? No problem. Anyway, I wanted to know—”</p>
<p>“Nelson’s dead,” Jimbo said, looking down.</p>
<p>“DEAD? How did—how did Nelson die? W-wasn’t he here with you?”</p>
<p>Bart was in shock. Besides Sherri and maybe Terri, Nelson was the group member closest to him. They were practically friends, even after everything they had lived through in their childhood and part of their teens. Collin, who barely knew him, didn’t react.</p>
<p>Terri intervened. “He saw the soldiers on the street, running, walking, marching… and he sacrificed himself, for all of us. Because we were a family to him, right? He left… and you left us here.”</p>
<p>“Not on purpose!” exclaimed Lisa. “We—there were so many people to get passports for, I-I had to get the money, Fat Tony was threatening me, I had to find my dad and—”</p>
<p>“It was always easy for you, Lisa. You were always the perfect one, you’re never wrong, everything is everyone else’s fault…”</p>
<p>“Enough!” Bart shouted, getting everyone’s attention. “We’re not doing this now. Calm down! Sure, my sister isn’t perfect, she can be arrogant, too rigid, and have a busted armpit,” he recounted, to the horror of Collin and his sister, “but she’s my sister. And we didn’t come here to fight, we came here to see if you’re okay, so we can get back to our lives.”</p>
<p>“<i>Nothin’s ever gonna be the same again!</i>” Kearney commented, breaking all standard rules of the English language.</p>
<p>“I know it won’t be. We’ve already lost so many people, and we have to stick together so we don’t lose any more, I don’t know, rebuild this place. What’s the point of us fighting now, after everything?”</p>
<p>The five Indelinquents present nodded in agreement. Collin and Lisa, wanting to prevent her brother from getting any more worked up, asked everyone to meet at Moe’s bar, where there would be a gathering of the survivors and the old visitors. They agreed.</p>
<p>As they left the house, Bart asked for a moment alone with Sherri. He hadn’t forgotten that, months before they left, she had told him she was pregnant with his child — but he didn’t know what had happened since. Her belly wasn’t that big.</p>
<p>“Sherri, about my, I mean, our chi—”</p>
<p>“I lost him.”</p>
<p>“Oh. Uh… um… wow.”</p>
<p>She put a hand on his shoulder.</p>
<p>“He would have suffered a lot these past months. I think it was for the best. I don’t want to talk about it now. Maybe later?”</p>
<p>“Maybe. I guess. Maybe…”</p>
<hr/>
<p>An hour or two later, the separate groups gathered at Moe’s bar, which was surprisingly intact, all things considered. In theory, the city center had been one of the hardest-hit areas, but there was an effort by the downtown shopkeepers to renovate the place. It looked much greener, for sure!</p>
<p>Lisa’s plan had worked: several of the residents who had gone abroad were reunited with their friends, family, and also the remaining residents of the city. The only part of the plan that hadn’t worked out was, ironically, everyone arriving well before she did. On the street in front of the bar, people were mingling with all sorts of drinks. Over there, Smithers — a figure the family had practically not seen since the incident at the plant — was there, chatting normally with some of his aides and plant employees. He seemed slightly embarrassed. Cleverly, Homer took the opportunity to politely ask (beg) for his job back. Knowing that the plant would now be in need of employees, and still believing that Lisa was cool enough to help with the reconstruction of the factory, he reluctantly agreed.</p>
<p>Also there, Bart reunited with Milhouse, although the meeting wasn’t much of a surprise; they had kept in frequent contact. Claire, Milhouse’s girlfriend, was there too. He couldn’t deny that, perhaps, he still had some kind of feeling for her — but he pushed it aside, understanding that his best friend was a better boyfriend for her than he had been. Much better, in fact. The two exchanged a brief smile and went back to talking about other things.</p>
<p>They weren’t the only ones to reunite, of course. In the crowd, a breathless Ned Flanders, who had refused the recommendation to flee the city, was looking for his two sons. Staying in the city had perhaps not been the best of choices, even though he had survived and so had his son Rod. He saw, from a distance, little Todd, along with Lenna, the woman he had been dating for almost a year, who had taken his son far away when he refused to leave. Well then. He hugged his son briefly, but noticed that Lenna wasn’t so enthusiastic. The conversation they would have later wasn’t going to be a good one, it seemed.</p>
<p>Among the many people there, Meg, now without Lexanna or anyone else, walked along the sidewalk (with difficulty — it was so crowded!) and pushed open the swinging door that led into Moe’s bar. Inside, a familiar figure in an apron. Ah, good old Moe. Unlike perhaps all the other encounters that had happened that day, this one had no running or falling to the ground. It was a simple walk that led to a long, and heartfelt, hug.</p>
<p>“Meg… it’s been a while…” Moe said, trying to start a conversation. But Meg, after so long without seeing the man who was practically her second father, preferred the silence. He quickly got the message; he did not need to belabor the point, after all. She cared about him anyway.</p>

      <figcaption>Happy.</figcaption>
    </figure>
<p>Several minutes later, outside, on a kind of small platform, Mayor Quimby was finishing some speech that few were paying attention to. Lisa, taking the opportunity, climbed onto the platform and began to get everyone’s attention.</p>
<p>“Everyone! I know things haven’t been the easiest, a lot has happened in recent years… but I know that together, we can make Springfield a better place… or at least, better than it is now.”</p>
<p>Some in the crowd murmured, others smiled, but those present applauded her loudly. She didn’t even have time to finish the speech she had planned, which was funny. This wasn’t exactly how she wanted to be recognized, and who knows how much money they’d ask to borrow now that the whole city knew she was <i>high society</i>, to an extent. Marge was happy for her daughter — how much she had learned! Amid the applause, she looked at some of the faces. She felt sad for those who had left them. She was worried about some people, like Lenna. She was happy her family was there, safe and sound. Some were talking amongst themselves; Frink Jr. and Grandson were intently discussing some experiment of theirs involving dead people with Lexanna. At this point, he was probably going to revive half the town in an experiment that would definitely go badly. (Or perhaps, go very well… just look at how it went for Sideshow Bob.) Collin was talking with his father, while Laura showed her son to Apu. Looking around at all the smiling faces, she realized Homer wasn’t there. She looked behind her, and he was leaving, moving away from the crowd and heading to the opposite side of the party. She went after him.</p>
<p>“Homer!” she shouted. He stopped in his tracks, giving her time to catch up. “What is it, are you leaving?”</p>
<p>“I’m going home. You know, live my life, with my dad—”</p>
<p>“But our house is a total mess!”</p>
<p>“Oh, right, well, it’s—” he tried not to stutter. “It’s my house, my apartment, you know? The one Lisa was paying for us…”</p>
<p>“But who says you’re going there?”</p>
<p>Homer was surprised. What was she trying to say?</p>
<p>“I mean, I’m very grateful that you and our kids let me live with you, but… I don’t know if you’ll still want me, you filed for divorce, the lawyer—”</p>
<p>Marge laughed. “What divorce?” She moved closer to Homer, taking his hands, now showing few remnants of the events of six months ago.</p>
<p>“You’re the father of our children. You’re still my husband.”</p>
<p>“I-I know, but… in the end, I’m <i>just another Simpson</i>.”</p>
<p>“Yes. The Simpson who didn’t let go of our hands. You saved our lives, you know, one way or another…”</p>
<p>Homer smiled. He couldn’t contain himself, and soon he wrapped her in a hug that, naturally, led to a kiss. It was so good… not just the kiss, but this tender affection, her scent… and also a wonderful smell of whiskey from the window next to them. Moe really was back in business.</p>
<p>Maybe this night wouldn’t be so bad after all… he made a mental note not to overdo it on the drinks. Not just because he wanted to, but also because fate willed it. How much he would have to fix, repair, buy, correct, formulate, how many verbs he’d have to invent just to get the sofa and the TV back in place… he decided to keep his eyes closed a little longer, even after the kiss ended.</p>
<p>Tomorrow would be a new day…</p>
