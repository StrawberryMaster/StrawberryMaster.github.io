    <p>Below you’ll find a list of some of my serious works, alongside some (probably) important links that belong here.
      (Psst: click directly on the names of the works to be sent to their respective locations.)</p>
    <div class="collection-grid">
      <div class="collection-card">
        <h3><a href="https://strawberrymaster.github.io/" target="_blank">Github site</a></h3>
        <p>The site where most of the projects are hosted on, on GitHub. I don’t really use it much, but it has a neat design.
        </p>
        <p class="links"><a href="https://github.com/StrawberryMaster/strawberrymaster.github.io"
            target="_blank">Repo</a></p>

      <div class="collection-card">
        <h3><a href="https://strawberrymaster.github.io/TrackGen/" target="_blank">TrackGen</a></h3>
        <p>A fork of the original TrackGen, which allows you to generate Wikipedia-like tropical cyclone tracks.
        It also has support for viewing certain track formats (ATCF, HURDAT, etc.) without having to install a third-party tool.
        As a bonus, you can also use your custom scales there, calculate the seasonal ACE, and use different maps!</p>
        <p class="links"><a href="https://github.com/StrawberryMaster/TrackGen" target="_blank">Repo</a></p>
      </div>

      <div class="collection-card">
        <h3><a href="https://strawberrymaster.github.io/hypo-track/" target="_blank">HypoTrack</a></h3>
        <p>Just like TrackGen above, except you can actually plot your tracks on a map, using your mouse! Neato.
        It’s a fork of Monsoonjr99’s hypo-track, though with a better performance because it does not have p5.js as a dependency.
        It allows you to export your tracks to a readable JSON or HURDAT format, which you can upload in TrackGen above
        for better viewing of the generated storm.</p>

      <div class="collection-card">
        <h3><a href="https://strawberrymaster.github.io/muzzard/" target="_blank">muzzard</a></h3>
        <p>A suite which includes a batch file downloader, a text formatter, and a text comparison tool, pretty much.
        It supports downloading multiple files per link and also zips your files,
        if you wish. Styling is based off Hunter S. Thompson’s "hey, rube!" column site on ESPN. </p>

        <h3><a href="https://github.com/StrawberryMaster/wayback-machine-downloader" target="_blank">wayback_machine_downloader</a></h3>
        <p>Per title. It’s a fork of the existing wayback_machine_downloader Ruby gem, with the advantage that it actually works! It also
        includes a few optimizations and other features, including better international site support, the ability to download "snapshots" of a
        site (similar to what the Wayback Machine does), and other really cool features.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://opapeldetrouxa.neocities.org/analysis/2016ALOT" target="_blank">A Lifetime of This</a></h3>
        <p>A rewritten &amp; enhanced version of the 2016 scenario for The Campaign Trail game, in the point of view of
          Hillary Clinton. Also included are three unlockable running mates and endings that will make you laugh (or cry).
          Complete with over 54 songs spread over three playlists, and 7 endings you can get!</p>

        <h3><a href="https://opapeldetrouxa.neocities.org/analysis/2016ALOT" target="_blank">Little Big Man</a></h3>
        <p>Basically the scenario above except it’s focused on the man himself, Barack Obama. It is more or less a rewritten &amp; enhanced version of the
          original 2012 Dan Bryan scenario for The Campaign Trail game, though also included are four unlockable running mates and endings that will also
          make you laugh (or cry).
          Complete with over 60 spread over three playlists, and more than 20 different endings you can get!</p>

        <h3><a href="https://strawberrymaster.github.io/bogle" target="_blank">bogle...</a></h3>
        <p>An anagram of the world globe, bogle is a map projection visualizer. Initially it was made using
        vanilla JS, until eventually I moved on to using <a href="https://d3js.org" target="_blank">d3.js</a>
        as it was much less broken, and made adding other projections much easier. Add your own images there
        and watch the magic happen!</p>

        <h3><a href="https://strawberrymaster.github.io/elgob" target="_blank">elgob...</a></h3>
        <p>Bogle’s cousin! It’s actually a rewritten version (in Python) of Wikipedia’s track generator (wptc-track),
        and has near-full compatibility with most functions of WPTC-TRACK.</p>

        <p>An updated version of the Minecraft mod of same name (with 1.21 support!). It allows you to use images on
          Minecraft (via the power of links and item frames).</p>
      </div>

        <h3><a href="https://strawberrymaster.github.io/penguin" target="_blank">Penguin, the book cover generator</a></h3>
        <p>A fork of an application that generated Penguin Classics and Oxford World’s Classics book covers, although
          slightly updated. I really like the design here.</p>

        <p>A fork (of a fork) of the original Weezer Sorter (which itself was also a fork of another sorter!),
        which you might’ve stumbled upon one day. Pick your favorite of two random Weezer songs until you see
        which song is your favorite, which one isn’t, and where a song falls on the chart!</p>

        <p>A WIP, based off the late IE Test Drive, intended to test how different pages behave in different

        <p>This is another fork, this time of my friend Monsoonjr99’s original cyclone-sim (a cyclone simulator!), with
          the goal to be (slightly) more performant than the original. Breaks more often than not, but it works well, I think.

        <p>Per title. A list of Twitter spam bots I’ve compiled since 2023 for you to export. I’m not sure why it grew
          so large — over 1000 accounts and still growing — but hopefully I will be able to check in the future whether
          the accounts listed here are still valid (i.e. active) or not. (Jesus, why so many?)</p>

          for fun, <a href="https://strawberrymaster.github.io/experiments/timetravel/" target="_blank">Time Travel
            1.3</a> (Dubya not included), a <a href="https://strawberrymaster.github.io/experiments/supermajority/"
            target="_blank">rather nifty supermajority calculator</a>, and other unrelated stuff. There’s also a
          stylesheet I made for <a href="https://www.nationstates.net">NationStates</a>, still one of my favorite sites

        <h3><a href="http://campaigns.270sims.com/2019/01/29/brazil-2018-sm" target="_blank">Brazil (2018)</a></h3>
        <p>A millennia ago, I made a scenario for the 2018 Brazilian presidential election on a game called President
          Infinity. Game limitations prevented me from adding the first round, but if you look at the game files, you’ll
          actually find images for all the first round candidates! I thought of adding them as surrogates, but only some
          were added by the time I finished the scenario.</p>
          <p>Psst: I recommend adding the code manually to the game scenario folder,
          due to UTF-8 limitations within the game’s code that cause special characters to break.</p>

          while.</p>

    <p>This is still a work in progress. I might finish this someday. Maybe.</p>
