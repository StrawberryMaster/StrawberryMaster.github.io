    <h1>There's nothing here... yet.</h1>
    <p>There really is nothing here. Really. You can trust me. But maybe there should be?</p>
    
    <p>Why is this page missing? We asked some leading economists on this.</p>
    
    <div class="economics-grid">
      <div class="economic-theory">
        <h4>Stagflation</h4>
        <p>The cost of pages rose drastically, while the page production rate slowed down.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="economic-theory">
        <h4>Monetarism</h4>
        <p>The government has limited the number of pages in circulation.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="economic-theory">
        <h4>General economics</h4>
        <p>There was no market for it.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="economic-theory">
        <h4>Efficient markets hypothesis</h4>
        <p>If you had paid enough for the page, it would have appeared.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="economic-theory">
        <h4>Liquidity traps</h4>
        <p>We injected some extra money into the technology team but there was little or no interest so they simply kept it, thus failing to stimulate the page economy.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="economic-theory">
        <h4>Moral hazard</h4>
        <p>Showing you this page would only encourage you to want more pages.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="economic-theory">
        <h4>Pareto inefficiency</h4>
        <p>There exists another page that will make everyone better off without making anyone worse off.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="economic-theory">
        <h4>Tragedy of the Commons</h4>
        <p>Everyone wanted to view this page, but no-one was willing to maintain it.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="economic-theory">
        <h4>Supply and demand</h4>
        <p>Demand increased and a shortage occurred.</p>
      </div>
       <div class="economic-theory">
        <h4>Game theory</h4>
        <p>By not viewing this page you help everyone else get better pages.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="economic-theory">
        <h4>Classical economics</h4>
        <p>There is no such page. We are not going to interfere.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="economic-theory">
        <h4>Mercantilism</h4>
        <p>The page is hosted by a foreign web server and is therefore banned to ensure the supremacy of our own software.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="economic-theory">
        <h4>Keynesian economics</h4>
        <p>Aggregate demand for this page did not necessarily equal the productive capacity of the website.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="economic-theory">
        <h4>Trickle-down</h4>
        <p>High taxes on content publishers prevented them hiring the person who would have written this page.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="economic-theory">
        <h4>Malthusianism</h4>
        <p>Unchecked, exponential page growth outstripped the pixel supply. There was a catastrophe, and now the population is at a lower, more sustainable level.</p>
      </div>
       <div class="economic-theory">
        <h4>Speculative bubble</h4>
        <p>The page never actually existed and was fundamentally impossible, but everyone bought into it in a frenzy and it's all now ending in tears.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="economic-theory">
        <h4>Neo-malthusianism</h4>
        <p>To avoid unchecked, exponential page growth outstripping the pixel supply and leading to an inevitable catastrophe, we prevented this page from being conceived.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="economic-theory">
        <h4>Socialism</h4>
        <p>If you were to get the page you wanted you might get a better page than someone else, which would be unfair. This way at least everyone gets the same.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="economic-theory">
        <h4>Marxism</h4>
        <p>The failure of this page to load is a consequence of the inherent contradictions in the capitalist mode of production.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="economic-theory">
        <h4>Behavioural economics</h4>
        <p>The influence of psychological factors caused you to act in a manner that would not be expected of a purely rational actor.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="economic-theory">
        <h4>Laissez-faire capitalism</h4>
        <p>We know this page is needed, but we can't force anyone to make it.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="economic-theory">
        <h4>Theory of the second best</h4>
        <p>The best outcome was unachievable, so you have arrived here instead.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
