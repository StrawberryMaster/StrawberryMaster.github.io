        <h2 class="story-title">Guanabara S/A (Guanabara Inc/O Cabresto)</h2>
        <div class="story-meta">Original Story | Political Drama</div>
        <p>Technically, my very first original story! Over here, two brothers (Jorge and Denise) and a friend (Diana) end up joining a childhood
          friend of theirs (Cadu) in their political campaign for governor of the state of Rio de Janeiro. When Cadu wins, he ends up bringing over Jorge
          (and, unintentionally, Denise and Diana) to his administration in some way, and they have to deal with the consequences of their involvement in
          it. Does something here make sense? I hope so, but all I know is that what happens in Rio, stays in
          Rio.<br /><br />I wrote this story with the placeholder title "O Cabresto", referring to <a
            href="https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voto_de_cabresto" target="_blank">voto de cabresto</a>, a way of buying
          votes in the early 20th century. I used Guanabara S/A (Guanabara Inc.) in the end mostly because it was a more
          commercial-sounding name, even though I don’t always use it when talking about the story.</p>

        <p>Yep. It’s a <a href="https://bully.fandom.com" target="_blank">Bully</a> story. Really good game too — you
          should play it if you haven’t! Over here, Pete thinks Gary is up to something, though he’s not quite
          sure what — and when he finds out, he wishes he hadn’t found out. Not very experimental, but there’s
          definitely an attempt at humor here. This is also one of my personal favorites; this was also the
          story where I reused a lot of the jokes I may or may not have used in my other, smaller stories.
          It worked out better here, honestly.
          As of June 2025, this is technically my longest story.</p>

        <h2 class="story-title">As</h2>
        <div class="story-meta">Story | Rick and Morty</div>
        <p>Admittedly, I’m not sure why this came into fruition — it was one of the ideas I contemplated writing about
          in mid to late 2023 (such as the story above), and the only reason why I delayed it for so long is that I
          thought it was trash. A few cleanups later and I thought it was <i>just</i> less trash than it was before, which is a
          net positive. Here, two Mortys find themselves in the Citadel of Ricks — but one of them is not who the other
          expects them to be. Bonus: some humor. Not to be confused with "As It Is When It Was", which also starts with
          "As".</p>

        <div class="story-meta">Story | Life is Strange (2015)</div>
        <p>At some point during early to mid 2024 I wrote a draft for this story, which wasn’t exactly bad, but was lacking and I
        never fully developed the ideas in it. A year later I revisited it, and noticed that I could try to make something out of it.
        Either way, I cleaned it up and turned it into a somewhat more coheren story. Here, it is not a fair world. If it was, Warren
        wouldn’t be having pseudo-therapy sessions with a friend and marinating in bed otherwise. In the midst of it all, he somehow
        makes an unlikely friend.</p>

        <div class="story-meta">Story | The Eltingville Club (1994)</div>
        <p>Of the stories I’ve made here, this is perhaps one of those I’ve least expected to make or write. But it’s
          not a bad story, surprisingly. Over here, at a late night meeting of the Eltingville Comic Book,
          Science-Fiction, Fantasy, Horror, and Role-Playing Club, a game of dominoes between Bill and Jerry goes
          horribly wrong. Per popular demand, there is now a bonus second chapter featuring Josh and Pete.
          Not to be confused with "As".</p>

        <div class="story-meta">Story | Kids (1995)</div>
        <p>See #As above. I’m not sure why I made this, but it’s a thing I started drafting around February 2025
          (although I had the idea for it for a while already), and in retrospect, I think it worked out quite well
          given its limitations. The story’s plot is that, after a long night, Fidget (psst: the character <span
          class="mytooltip">Harmony Korine<span class="mytooltiptext"><img src="https://i.pinimg.com/1200x/d2/f9/6c/d2f96c0207155bfd0bad4eb236347970.jpg">He’s got a headache, I think.</span></span> portrays in the movie) goes to his friend Steven’s apartment to search for his friend Jennie.
          Originally a oneshot, but I wrote an extra chapter after popular demand, showing Fidget meeting up with Telly to inform him of, well, events.</p>

        <div class="story-meta">Original Story | Humour</div>
        <p>This is a bit of a weird story, but you may like it! Here, Darcy, a vain <i>nouveau rich</i> woman, enjoys a
          business trip to the (United) States. Meanwhile, her friend Ian is working at a petrol station run by her,
          where nothing happens, and he spends most of the time dealing with his "co-worker" of sorts, Pierre. The two
          of them try to make some sense into what was happening to them, which they fail miserably at. This was created
          under the title "O Mal Encarnado" (The Evil Incarnate), which was always meant to be a temporary title.</p>

        <p>A bit of an experiment, this story was written almost entirely using text-to-speech (TTS), and reviewed
          manually. Here, a former children’s show host turned late night presenter named Maristela, during her
          birthday, agrees to help her friend (also a former children’s show host, named Nathan) turnaround a failing school play in
          eight days. Technically in the same universe as Guanabara S/A a few cards above.</p>

        <div class="story-meta">Original Story | Political Drama</div>
        <p>Essentially a redux of O Cabresto — almost. The main difference is that this is a shorter story and the cast
          itself has no idea what "ethics" means. At least not everyone... this story is through the point of view of
          Otto, one-third of a folktronica/pop/rock trio who finds himself in a secret society of teenagers and young
          adults where a lot of stuff goes wrong — and a lot of people die along the way, and not necessarily in good
          ways. He gets the help of Michael and Theo, two Frenchmen who are not what they seem, especially Theo.</p>

        <div class="story-meta">Adaptation, sorta</div>
        <p>See analysis of the story <a href="/analysis/simpsons">here</a>.</p>
        <p>Okay, this one needs so many explanations that it probably warrants its own page. For starters: there is a
          The Simpsons fanfic titled <i><a href="https://www.spiritfanfiction.com/historia/nao-mais-simpsons-14312693"
              target="_blank">No More Simpsons</a></i> (Não Mais Simpsons), which happens in a world where Homer is a
          lazy drunk, Marge is significantly disturbed by her husband’s lack of care for her and the rest of the family,
          Bart is a sex-crazed maniac, Lisa has a best friend, and Maggie (herein Meg) is a boxer. It’s probably the
          longest Simpsons fanfic in terms of chapters, standing at a whopping 218. Its author, a journalism student
          named Brendon, died in 2023, leaving the story without an ending. "Just Another Simpson" is essentially my
          version of the story’s three remaining chapters, intended as a homage to the original author.</p>

        <div class="story-meta">Story | South Park</div>
        <p>It’s hard to describe why this story came into existence in the first place, but I guess my nostalgia for
          early South Park led to this. Over here, Cartman’s latest genius plan takes him and Butters to Scotland in
          search of the Loch Ness Monster. Naturally, it ends very badly, especially when they find out what their
          friends down in South Park were doing while they were gone.</p>

        <div class="story-meta">Experimental | Façade</div>
        <p>You know <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Façade_(video_game)" target="_blank">Façade</a>, the 2000s
          game? Although the game has been known more recently for more melon-y stuff, it’s a fun game to play every now
          and then. In early March 2024, I discovered one of my old screenplays I had (one of the longest, too) and
          attempted to make a story out of it. It’s not bad, I guess, but it’s more experimental than anything; here, a
          guy named Ben pays a visit to the apartment of his lifelong friends, Grace and Trip, although none of the
          three will be having an easy night.<br /><br />I wrote this story in Notepad while cleaning up the transcript
          it generated, which was not a wise decision. It led to me cleaning it up twice, once in November 2024 and once
          on March 15, 2025, where I rewrote part of it.</p>

        <div class="story-meta">Story | Zero Day</div>
        <p>How this exists is beyond me. The best way I can describe this story is that it was a leftover of a series of
          ideas I had for other, more casual stories. It never developed into anything, but the idea of something more
          "mundane" ended up carrying over here — which, given the movie and its subject nature, contrasted quite well.
          Here, after an unbelievably boring movie session, Cal and Andre make tomato soup. I initially wrote this under
          the title "About Last Night...", which I changed after realizing there was nothing to say about last night.
          It later developed into "The Strangest Thing" and, eventually, Spinning the Wheel, and it’s not hard to guess
          these were both named after songs in <i><span

        <p>This is a half-serious story, I think. It was written around December 2023 and retouched for
          a 2024 release. It’s essentially a short satire story showing the day-to-day life of then-Twitter/X CEO Linda
          Yaccarino; in particular it was made right after an interview from the Musk where he ranted against
          advertisers. There’s also a squirrel infestation going on and a guest appearance from the Zuck.</p>

        <p>This is actually a funny story that needs some additional info from me. In the past, I especially liked
          watching this Brazilian YouTube channel named <a href="https://tazercraft.fandom.com/wiki/TazerCraft"
            target="_blank">TazerCraft</a>, a duo who made several Minecraft series, including one that became known as
          "<a href="https://tazercraft.fandom.com/wiki/Fuga_Imposs%C3%ADvel" target="_blank">Fuga Impossível</a>" (<span
            class="mytooltip">Impossible Escape<span class="mytooltiptext"><img

              Impossível/Impossible Escape" was a 15-episode series that showed the lives of Pac (first on the left) and
              Mike (last on the right) in the infamous Alcatraz prison after a failed bank robbery. The reboot of a
              less-known 2012 series of same name, the new Impossible Escape became an instant hit at its release,
              becoming one of the channel’s most famous works.</span></span>). This series, which was actually pretty
          influential for the year it was released (2015), got a revival when its backstory was essentially canonized on
          "<a href="https://tazercraft.fandom.com/wiki/QSMP" target="_blank">QSMP</a>" (the Quackity SMP), which at the time,
          still had a community. <br /><br /> Lacking familiarity with part of the
          QSMP cast team, I decided to do an Impossible Escape-themed oneshot. Due to some positive comments I received,
          a couple of months later I made it a full-fledged story, and people also liked it! Given how the SMP catastrophically
          imploded much later, I’m actually kinda surprised this story aged somewhat well. It’s in Portuguese, so I
          strongly encourage you to translate it using an external translator (such as <a
            href="https://www.deepl.com/pt-BR/translator" target="_blank">DeepL</a>) so you get less confused.</p>
